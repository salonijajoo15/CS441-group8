Conservative,hot,Vance calls Rubio ‘my best friend in the administration’ despite 2028 ticket talk,,44,39,5,"I am curious if they will agree to a Vance/Rubio ticket prior to the primaries starting. That would give them a huge advantage over others and allow them to immediately go after the democrats. They would probably be able to start building a huge stock pile of cash too. 

Democrats have Newscum and the bartender as front runners with Kacklin' pretending she has a say in the matter. The democrat machine knows AOC isn't electable in a general, bootyjudge isn't electable and any other name doesn't have the recognition to beat a Vance/Rubio ticket. Newscum, despite being a plague on California is at this point, the only real option the dems have.

Republicans are looking very strong for 2028. Trump has proven to be a far greater president than Biden and Obama were and will be carrying a ton of momentum into 2028.

Better announce clearly in their preferred language they are about to be tased or shot!

I wonder if sane liberals have realized that, if Trump and conservatives were as evil as media prophets claim, then why are things going quite well?

Sure, rabid Redditors, 'No Kings' crowd (comprised primarily of old former hippies and a few 'Trump is Hitler' folks), join the MSNBC folks who peddle sensationalism via their yellow journalism tactics. 

This isn't new. After all, William Randolph Heart, the old newspaper tycoon and Democratic Party congressman from California said, ""*We will always sell the news*. *If there is no news, we'll make the news!*"" 

Just today, I received a nasty comment from some guy online. 

Some time back, I had written a comment on Quora about wearing a Philadelphia Phillies cap at a Northern California deli. A woman asked me what the ""P"" means. I explained that it stands for the ""Philadelphia Phillies."" She replied saying that she thought it might have been one of those MAGA caps and she was going to ask me to leave the deli. This woman wasn't the owner or manager. She was just another customer.

Conservative,hot,Why Is New Yorkâs AG Targeting a Castle in West Virginia?,,10,7,3,"It's crazy that Leticia James is targeting someone over real estate. 

There is another guy that I know who moved to West Virginia to fulfill his life-long dream of building his own castle. I happened to find his website which detailed his progress over the years while I was a freshman in college. 

Over the last couple of decades, this man (retired from tech) has been building a castle in the Mountain State because rural areas in West Virginia have less constant regulation. It was easier (and less costly) to get his plans approved. It was also easier to get his work inspected too. 

I don't know anything about ""VDARE;"" however, this sounds like political and ideological targeting. I think that the best case to look at is *Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah* (1992). 

A weird voodoo religious cult (i.e., the ""Church of the Lukumi Babalu"") had recently moved into Hialeah, Florida. There, they began doing some of their peculiar religious practices (including animal sacrifice and subsequent eating of the animal). Afterward, the city passed laws banning such practices. 

SCOTUS found against the City of Hialeah partially because the application of law and ordinances that were not ""neutral."" This is the key part that many people miss. Liberals often pass laws and ordinances after the fact as a means to target groups that they disagree with.

Conservative,hot,Why Is New Yorkâs AG Targeting a Castle in West Virginia?,,10,7,3,"So the background here, for people who are wondering why this is an issue and likely have never even heard of VDARE, and have no idea who Virginia Dare was, is that for many years,   VDARE has been an incredibly productive and consistently steadfast organization over the years and just one of the few media outlets that has been publishing the voices of advocates of the interests of white peoples of the world, a group that is the smallest racial minority, globally.  Despite continual efforts, most people have never even heard of it, and there's a good explanation for that.

Basically, for the last 30 years or the so, the MSM has been extremely racist but only just against whites.  Those pundits, journalists, activists or other experts who advocated for the interests of white peoples were shamed, shunned and excoriated by the corporate ethnic cartel media that supports and promotes and celebrates the ethnic/racial/cultural identities of all other groups but denies that same identity and its celebration or promotion to white peoples.

So that's why sites such as VDARE existed. Because of the censorship, hostility, and exclusion/persecution by the corporate media cartel.  As eagerly and zealously as it has promoted the interests of all other racial groups, it has just as eagerly and zealously sought to silence and prevent the promotion or discussion of any interests of the white peoples.",1,2025-10-29 14:54:58,2025-10-29 18:46:33,-0.95

In California you're used to waiting a year for a small project or multiple years for a substantial one. Substantial as in burger shack or small as in personal exercise pool.

It's not because it takes 10-20x longer for concrete to dry, it's because you submit a form then it goes into a pile and the pile sits there. Then you get one step further at some random point, *then you submit the form for the next leg of the journey.* Again and again and again I was worried the construction company was falling apart and had left us behind.

I'm republican, I know I have a bias, but I try to stay cognisant of it and critically examine anything I support...

King of New York/Manhattan is my guess, he's been heavily involved in New York business and politics since before the 80s. During one of his rallies in New York last year, his son said ""the king of New York is back to reclaim the city he built"". So, if you take things objectively, this is a simple and likely explanation. Of course we can't know what he truly meant, but given the context and his history with the city, it makes sense.

He also never said there wouldn't be another election, he was appealing to a specific religious group who notoriously was difficult to get to the polls. He said, get to the polls this one time and I'll fix america so well, you won't even have to think about needing to vote again (because things would be so good, it wouldn't matter who's in charge). Silly? Yes, of course, hyperbolic? Yes, of course. Did he mean he'd eliminate elections? No.

I won't defend what he's recently said about Ukraine or Zelensky other than by ""start the war"", it's my impression he *probably* meant ""not negotiate better"", as he's said that many many times and has remained consistent with that message. He shouldn't have said it, either way, I object to him saying anything like it. Ukraine has shown tremendous resolve and have been fighting heroically, I have nothing but admiration and respect for them. Russia is unequivocally the bad guy, the aggressor and the one in the wrong, period.

 He shouldn't have said that quote about you're not breaking the law if you're saving your country. Reddit has been flooded with similar sentiment, but from the left, so if you object to him saying it, you'll also have to look at the other side's belief that they'd *also* be justified in doing the same thing. It's easy to say it's treasonous until you're the one feeling justified in espousing it. HOWEVER, it's unacceptable for him to tweet that without any further elaboration.",2749,2025-02-19 23:56:41,2025-02-20 00:27:20,-0.5

Conservative,top,They're tariffing literally everyone,,16955,16107,848,"I think blanket tariff policy is a braindead economic plan. The apparent “tariffs” placed on us per trumps calculations factor in trade deficits which are not inherently bad. If a country runs a trade deficit with us meaning we import from them more than they take our exports it usually means we are indebted to them. The typical process is they take that debt and invest in bonds thats grow when the value of the dollar grows essentially giving us the ability to not have to pay our “debt” and allowing other countries to invest in us. However, i am all for weaponization of tariffs to force countries like russia to come to the table and make a deal. This tariff policy i fear is going to ruin a lot of the free trade agreements we have. Hell it has already violated many free trade agreements like the one we have with israel. Israel made a promise to open free trade with the US and has stuck to that promise but yet on trumps chart it says they tariff us which is factually incorrect. Part of my distain could be that im down 10% in 2 days, but i just dont see how this is sustainable. Id love to hear from someone the technical details on how tariff policy is sustainable and/or a replacement of other taxes.",86,2025-04-03 22:13:43,2025-04-04 15:14:54,0

I am hypothesizing a lot of you guys who are supporting Trump’s Tariffs right now are having some major cognitive dissonances. A quick way I would argue against you and point out your cognitive dissonance is to ask your feelings about his Tariffs at regular intervals of like idk 6 months. 

This test is really testing how you are able to rationalize your negative feelings and emotions due to financial difficulties vs your ideological/political beliefs with Trump’s Tariffs. I truly doubt that if these policies/stock market trends the same way it is today that you will be able to hold your current set of beliefs for 2 years. (I’m make it 2 years because the longer this goes on the likelier my hypothesis will be correct). Who actually knows how long this will go on for though… (yaaa gotta love having an unpredictable financial future ahead of me!)

Only mods can see your posts. Usually we approve you if you're not rude, but since the shooting, we stopped caring what you think. Frankly, you're all just making fun of a murder or making things up like ""THE SHOOTER WAS MAGA"" anyways. You can say whatever you wish, but only 1 or 2 people will ever read it, and we just sit in Discord laughing at you.

This is a courtesy to let you know that you are wasting your time. Feel free to keep shouting into the great wall of automod I guess though.

I still can't wrap my mind around how a reporter could accidentally be added to this thread. There's gotta be more there. At worst Mike is a rat and trying to make the administration look bad. At best it was a stupid mistake, but the administration still looks bad. And its defenders look like morons- is Signal secure or not? If not, heads should roll. If it is, how were they able to add a reporter? Heads should still roll.


The mental gymnastics and semantics of ""war plans"" vs ""attack plans"" is a really bad look. Trump should have blown up, fired Mike Waltz immediately and gave Hegseth/Vance a dressing-down at the very least. No accountability for clear fuckups.",2111,2025-03-26 13:25:02,2025-03-26 15:42:40,0.5

Conservative,top,Atlantic reporter publishes full texts from Houthi group chat,,15093,14489,604,"After seeing all the messages, it certainly seems like this would be classified information. 

The initial posts I saw shared on the linked article here don’t seem to indicate actual targets, just terrorist, so that doesn’t look bad, but in the screenshots they’re talking specifically about the Suez and shipping lanes, and Houtis, and even then voice concern about info leaking - so if they’re worried about what they’re **actively** discussing leaking and impacting operations there’s an acknowledgement that this is sensitive (at least) information. 

Obviously I don’t expect anything to happen to any of these people, they serve at the pleasure of the president and within the conservative community there’s a big split on how bad, if it’s bad, this leak is. 

I’m of the opinion I’d rather be good than get lucky, and this was luck that nothing critical leaked, cuz if this was a different or different journalist maybe they would leak it in real time and fuck up the plans, you know?",385,2025-03-26 13:25:02,2025-03-26 18:13:39,-0.3

I feel like this line spoils the ending.

But yeah, Trump's first 6 months have been pretty great overall, but towards the end of that period he did make 3 big blunders.

His falling out with Musk (that's on both), his big bulk bill and of course the way he handles the Epstein issue and has made himself, at best, an accomplice in a massive crime.",273,2025-07-27 02:41:44,2025-07-27 11:03:33,0.5
Conservative,top,If you voted for Donald Trump-- everything happening in America right now is all on you. It doesn't matter what reason you had. It's time to take accountability.,"Donald Trump has told us who he is for decades now, he's told us what he's planned to do, and so has his inner circle. If you didn't know what you were signing up for in 2016, maybe you did just get swept away in the hype and weren't fully cognizant of his entire platform. But 2024 was his third campaign. You knew. You've known for years.

You knew that Trump would give $45 billion dollars to ICE and lay the groundwork for mass deportation.

You knew that Trump would dismantle entire federal agencies and end almost all foreign aid.

You knew that Trump would end DEI initiatives.

You knew that Trump would renegotiate trade deals to prioritize Americans over our allies.

You knew that Trump would pull us out of UN organizations.

You knew that Trump would defund NPR, PBS, and left-wing universities.

You knew that Trump would prevent illegal immigrants from receiving free cosmetic surgery.

You knew that Trump would send the Marines to stop lawless protests.

You knew that Trump would pressure companies to remove artificial dyes and replace corn syrup with sugar.

You knew that Trump would bring border crossings down to their lowest number in history.

It's easy to point towards Trump and go ""it's his administration, he's the one doing it""-- but it was only possible because YOU voted for him. He didn't just win the election, he won the popular vote. Even if you lived in a ""safe blue state"", your vote has made his administration feel like they have a nationwide mandate to advance every single item on its agenda.

Well done! Keep up the good work, and here's to successful midterms.",14420,8507,5913,[removed],508,2025-07-27 02:41:44,2025-07-27 03:04:25,0.9

Conservative,top,"Matt Gaetz paid underage girl $400 for sex, US ethics report finds",,10564,9190,1374,"**From The Telegraph:**

Matt Gaetz violated Florida laws by paying a 17-year-old girl for sex and purchasing drugs illegally, CBS News reported on Monday, citing the final draft of a US House ethics committee report.

The former Florida representative, who has denied wrongdoing, resigned from the House last month after he was selected by Donald Trump, the president-elect, to be attorney general.

He withdrew from consideration for the role, however, in the face of an uphill confirmation battle in the Senate.

The report, to be released on Monday, found that Gaetz paid more than $90,000 (£72,000) to 12 different women, and that this was probably in connection with sexual activity and drug use, CBS reported.

The ethics panel received testimony that Mr Gaetz twice had sex with a 17-year-old girl, identified in the report as “Victim A”, at a party in 2017, CBS reported.

“Victim A recalled receiving $400 in cash from Representative Gaetz that evening, which she understood to be payment for sex,” CBS quoted the report as saying. 

“Victim A said that she did not inform Representative Gaetz that she was under 18 at the time, nor did he ask her age.”

The former Congressman had denied having sex with an underage girl.

Mr Gaetz was the subject of a three-year FBI investigation into allegations of sex-trafficking that produced no criminal charges.

But I’d also be surprised if the Clintons, more politicians from both sides, celebrities, etc are also on it. 

There’s a reason the Dems didn’t release it when they could have. 

I also think Trump overplayed his hand. In hindsight, I think he knew that he was on it, but never thought it would actually get released, and he used that for political points at the time. It backfired and honestly will be, of all things, the things that will bring him down in the end.",1141,2025-07-24 13:59:25,2025-07-24 15:28:03,0.5

I mean that full honestly. The US don’t want to be involved, that’s fine, but if Ukraine wants to keep fighting, let them. And Ukraine has already signaled they won’t stop and right now it doesn’t look like that Europe will stop support either.

And if Europe wants to keep supporting them, it should be in US‘s favor, wouldn’t it?

If Europe really will send those 700billion that came up yesterday and if Ukraine would really buy weapons from China with it, well it would strengthen the position of China.

The smart way would it to make sure that this money would be spent in the US or Europe, but talking like this about another leader won’t lead to this.

One way or the other, as the things are currently, the war won’t end. There will maybe be diplomatic relations between Russia and the US again, but for the rest the war won’t end.

Hell even Erdogan signaled only yesterday that Ukraine will have Turkeys full support. And Turkey is probably already nearly on eye level with Russia military wise.

So this will end in a death end, and if Trump won‘t be careful, it will lead to a situation where the West will break apart and Europe will side with China. There are already massive talks about this here.

Conservative,top,🚨 Trump announces the U.S. has bombed Iran.,,8886,8352,534,"Iran is weaker than us but not so weak that they can’t harm us. This is an act of war and we can all make the equivocations all we want that it’s not boots on the ground or what have you but our military bombed their country’s government. That’s an act of war. 

There’s no great plan of action from here and this is not our war.If we’re not in the sandbox it’s not our problem. Iran is a much bigger problem for Israel than us and we’ve allowed them to make this our problem. The idea that they’re just going to have peace talks after this is crazy.

Israel cannot occupy the country, they can’t force a regime change or hold territory in such a way to make Iran capitulate. This is a bombing run without a way to force them to stop afterwards. They can hold out, they can rebuild and they will hold a grudge. This is a half assed war that just further bogs us down in the ME. 

Trump said no more wars, this is a war. We can defeat Shia militias, we can defeat their proxies but why the hell should we when we’ve got so many other problems all over? Why should even a few soldiers die for this cause? Resources we could deploy at home, elsewhere abroad and with far greater benefit to the United States. 

Trump is not the anti-war president",1215,2025-06-21 23:55:30,2025-06-22 01:22:44,0.6

Elon is the only one that beat his chest first and did anything close to an actual “Nazi salute”. All three of the other still pictures are misleading and in reality not even close to the same. Go to NYC for a day and you could take dozens of still pictures of this exact thing. Have you ever hailed a taxi before?

YES, he said “my heart goes out to you” after doing the awkward gesture. And I agree that it explains it, he’s not doing a Nazi salute, and this is another case of people clipping something to make it misleading. I don’t like Elon (a surprise, I’m sure) and even I can see that. 

HOWEVER, this post is doing the exact same thing as those that clip Elon’s video. It’s shortchanging people on actual information and making it easy to draw a false conclusion.

Conservative,controversial,I'm a registered Democrat and I'm voting for Trump this election,"I live in a very liberal state and have historically voted Democrat. However, this election  I've decided to vote Trump for president, and here's why:

1.Jobs and Economy: I've seen many people laid off, and finding new jobs has become increasingly difficult. I experienced this firsthand, taking a long time to find work that pays significantly less than what I earned before.

2.Inflation and Housing Crisis: Everything feels unaffordable now, especially housing. The rise in homelessness and the emergence of shantytowns in some places are heartbreaking, and it's sad to see so many struggling.

3. Border Security: The increase in illegal border crossings poses a significant security risk, which has worsened a lot under the current administration.

4. International Conflicts: We've seen multiple global conflicts escalate with no resolution in sight.

5. Lack of Clear Policy: Kamala Harris hasn’t articulated a concrete plan for improving our situation. In fact, she’s indicated that she wouldn't have done much differently than Biden, which concerns me greatly.

While I would love to see a woman president, I can't support Kamala Harris, as I want to avoid a repeat of the last four years. I’m looking for a strong economy, a robust job market, increased border/national security, and an end to unnecessary wars. This election, I'm prioritizing policy, which is why I’m voting for Trump.

My wife has been acting weird lately. I have always been able to read off her phone but lately she has been hiding it. I was very worried she was talking to another guy and/or having an affair. 

Yesterday she was using her phone and put it down, went into the bathroom and started to shower. I realized she forgot her phone as lately she would basically hide it when showering. 

I went through her messages, contacts, calls, etc, and found nothing. No unusual pics, calls or emails. Then I started looking through her apps and saw reddit. She has never mentioned it before. I was terrified she was having an affair but what I found was so much worse.

Her reddit account has hundreds of posts and they are all on r/Conservative! She defends Trump and Republicans! How could she! I can't believe I am married to a nazi. I was heart broken. I was literally shaking! She knows our neighbors and uncles who voted Trumpf all regret it now! I cut off all contact with them but I am sure they regret it!

There was not a single hate post or pedo accusation against Trump. Not one. Not a single post exposing Stephen Miller for being Satan. In fact she was defending them! She didn't even call out Fallon for having Gutfeld on! All her posts were like, ""Trump is doing a good job here but could be better if...""

WTF! How can she humanize Drumpf??!! Orange man is actually worse than Hitler, how could she!! I feel victimized by this betrayal. One post said the Sidney Sweeney ad ""wasn't even a big deal""! Another post claimed we were ""on the right track"" regarding tariffs when we are certainly heading towards a great depression. This has caused me so much anxiety and mental anguish. She said it wasn't ok to attack federal law enforcement who we all know are terrorist agents of the orange man who is sending people to death camps!!!

I packed up my stuff, took our kids and am staying at my mom's. I can't be in the same house as a nazi and my neodivergent, gender fluid 2 year old twins have been very sad about mommy being a racist pedo supporter and Russian agent.

Yesterday she was using her phone and put it down, went into the bathroom and started to shower. I realized she forgot her phone as lately she would basically hide it when showering. 

I went through her messages, contacts, calls, etc, and found nothing. No unusual pics, calls or emails. Then I started looking through her apps and saw reddit. She has never mentioned it before. I was terrified she was having an affair but what I found was so much worse.

Her reddit account has hundreds of posts and they are all on r/Conservative! She defends Trump and Republicans! How could she! I can't believe I am married to a nazi. I was heart broken. I was literally shaking! She knows our neighbors and uncles who voted Trumpf all regret it now! I cut off all contact with them but I am sure they regret it!

There was not a single hate post or pedo accusation against Trump. Not one. Not a single post exposing Stephen Miller for being Satan. In fact she was defending them! She didn't even call out Fallon for having Gutfeld on! All her posts were like, ""Trump is doing a good job here but could be better if...""

WTF! How can she humanize Drumpf??!! Orange man is actually worse than Hitler, how could she!! I feel victimized by this betrayal. One post said the Sidney Sweeney ad ""wasn't even a big deal""! Another post claimed we were ""on the right track"" regarding tariffs when we are certainly heading towards a great depression. This has caused me so much anxiety and mental anguish. She said it wasn't ok to attack federal law enforcement who we all know are terrorist agents of the orange man who is sending people to death camps!!!

I packed up my stuff, took our kids and am staying at my mom's. I can't be in the same house as a nazi and my neodivergent, gender fluid 2 year old twins have been very sad about mommy being a racist pedo supporter and Russian agent. 

Am I the asshole? Planning on divorcing her. She has a job and pays all the bills. I stay at home raising the twins and use my free time to anger smash the downvote button on all r/Conservative posts. It's an honest days work. ",408,228,180,"OP, I don’t think you fully realize the danger you and your twins narrowly escaped. This isn’t just “a difference of opinion” — this is *how fascism starts*. First it’s “Trump had some good policies,” next thing you know she’s goose-stepping to Costco to buy bulk tiki torches.

You were absolutely right to take the kids and go to your mom’s. Studies (that I just made up) show that prolonged exposure to conservative viewpoints can cause irreversible empathy loss, a 73% decrease in pronoun usage, and spontaneous flag-waving episodes. I shudder to think what could have happened if your 2-year-old had accidentally seen her reading The Federalist.

Honestly, the fact she’s paying all the bills while you heroically fight fascism online just proves she was trying to lull you into a false sense of security — classic authoritarian grooming tactic. Don’t fall for it. Keep smashing that downvote button, patriot. You’re literally saving democracy one Reddit click at a time.

Stay strong. We’re all with you in this resistance.",174,2025-08-10 13:56:06,2025-08-10 16:35:11,0.9

Remember that this is Trump’s last term. He cannot run again. He’ll be in his mid 80s when he’s done, so quite possibly not even king maker for the conservative cause. 

Point being let’s enjoy tomorrow, enjoy these next four years but also stay focused. The cancer is in remission, it’s not gone. We will hear about women’s rights and racism, war and democracy first as whispers and then as howls. 

If we beat them again in four years I believe they’ll be done for. They’re going to try again one more time, harder than ever after this. Let’s start thinking of a world post Trump and how to keep our values and virtues moving. If we can do that, it’ll be a Golden *Age* and not a Golden *Term*…

They shot you.
They shot our brothers and sisters.
They shot everything Charlie stood for and every single one of us who agrees with him.

They shot free speech.

And ironically enough, all that survived is the idea of Charlie Kirk - which we must never let die.

They killed a man, a father, a husband - but they amplified his spirit.

Let us peacefully show them just what they have ignited within us.
