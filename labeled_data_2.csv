Liberal,controversial,What is liberal view on illegal immigration? I feel like a republican about it. ,"I find myself struggling to be upset that Trump might do these mass deportations. 

I care greatly that they are done within the law and in a compassionate manner, but I don't think it is wrong to deport people who came here illegally or overstayed a visa. 

DACA and asylum are different for the sake of this post. 

I was never open borders, but I used to be a bit of the ""people can't be illegal"" type. 

As I have seen more of the reality of barely checked immigration on local governments and economies (i.e. companies paying lower wages to illegals), i have shifted positions some. 

I want more legal immigration and better border processes, and I think illegal immigration is a bad hill to die on for the left. 

Feeling like a failed lib/progressive. 

Anyone else?

The conservatives of reddit believe the inverse is true. Is it? I don't know. I do know these things: far more entities on social media are fake— either not who they say they are, or A.I., than we truly understand.

Liberal,controversial,The conservatives can use social media better then the liberals?,"Hello I heard this thing going around but I think the conservatives can use social media better then liberals can. I think a big reason why trump won in the 2024 election is because he was able to use social media better then haris could. I feel that Trump was able to use it to get the youth Gen z as a result. After all he did talk to Logan Paul and a few others to what a gen z man might be listening to. Harris didn't do any of this I feel that even when something is necessarily true conservatives can lie better to people on social media and still get away with it. For example during Trump state of the union speech he referred to as mice being transgender when he mixed up the word for something else and yet he was able to lie and make it seem factual and his voters ate it up. Trump also talked about do to how great his tarrifs are Honda was opening a plant In the U.S and opening up jobs but the company already said the plant exist and they are not hiring. What amazes me honestly is that conservatives can lie better in the media and soical media and get thier voters to still belive it. 

For example look at reddit thier are more conservatives here then thier are liberals. I think conservatives have a bigger soical media preference. I think conservatives do it better at using social media to spread the word. This is why I feel liberals need to improve to use social media better..",0,0,0,"Magats use social media to spread hate and lies. Hate and lies always travel faster than truth and goodwill.

Others buy into the false narratives created by Trump and his surrogates, which allow them to pick and choose the things they like about him, whether or not they're true or not. 

If this seems unlikely, keep in mind that most of the people who voted for Trump are right-wing Christians. Who regularly pick and choose what they feel is true out of their Bible.

The current administration is concentrating an unpredidented amount of power under their direct control.

They are arresting political figures who speak out against them. And, tragically, they are rhetorically encouraging vigilantism against both everyday American people and opposition political figures, which claimed 2 more lives in MN just last night.

Liberal,controversial,The Republican party appears to be becoming less homophobic.,"In 2020, the supreme court ruled that employment discrimination against gay people is unconstitutional. The reason behind this decision was as follows. If a man, who is in a relationship with another man, is subject to employment discrimination because he is in a relationship with a man, but a woman can be in a relationship with a man without facing any such discrimination, that is gender discrimination. Republican justices John Roberts and Neil Gorsuch (who were appointed by George W Bush and Donald Trump respectively) voted with the majority. Two Republican justices voted in favor of gay rights. 

Open a US history textbook and you may notice a trend that has occurred over the past 150 years. There is a group of people (women, gay people, racial minorities, etc.) who do not enjoy the same rights and protections under the law as others. There is controversy there. The issue really is as simple as; one side of the debate says that this group should enjoy the same rights and opportunities as everyone else, the other side believes that that group of people should be treated as second class citizens. The latter group’s entire argument is it is good when X group does it but yucky when Y group does it. The controversy really is as simple as that. When this happens, usually; A few people to the left of the political spectrum speak up and advocate for this positive change, but it seems unlikely that this change will ever occur. Year after year, more and more people on the political left not only advocate for it but attend marches and hold protests. Eventually, pretty much everyone on the left supports giving equal rights to this marginalized group, and the right is deeply divided on whether or not these people should enjoy equal rights. Decades later, we have reached a point where the vast majority of people (barring a very small minority of people) agree that the right in question should be granted to all people. It is amazing to most of us that this was ever controversial. 

Here are a few examples of what I mean. 

When the constitution was first ratified, women could not vote. Around the late 19th and early 20th century, a small minority of people began to entertain the thought that maybe women should vote. Most people (even women themselves) believed otherwise. Some people worried that women were too emotional to vote. To that I say; who is to say that being emotional automatically means that any vote you cast will be misguided. Some people felt that every woman would just vote the same as her husband. Not only is there a fairly decent chance that at least some women (maybe even a lot of women) would not vote the same way as their husbands, this argument fails to consider that unmarried people might vote. The social custom where women and children were to be the first ones rescued in a disaster was created to fuel the idea that women do not need to vote, because men will always prioritise women’s interests when voting. To that I say, women could also prioritize men’s best interests when voting. After all, every man who has ever voted would not have been able to vote if his mother had not given him life. Besides, women bring a unique perspective that men are not capable of bringing and vice versa. Even if men prioritize women’s best interests when voting, there may be certain things these men did not consider that a woman may have been more likely to consider. When the 19th amendment was ratified, a lot of people were mad about it. Nowadays, the vast majority of people agree that women should be allowed to vote. In fact, it seems kind of surprising that anyone would ever be against letting women vote. 

Throughout the first half of the 20th century, black where were oppressed by Jim Crow laws and other racist policies. In the supreme court case known as Plessey V Ferguson, it was ruled that, things that are for black people and things that are for white people could be separate, but they had to be equal. The problem of course is that a lot of the time, they where not equal. If you had one restaurant for whites and another for colored people, the bathrooms in the white restaurants would be cleaner, the cooks in the white restaurant would be more skilled and experienced, etc. Apparently, if a black man had just used the bathroom, there is something wrong with it. If a white man uses that same bathroom, the white man will become infected with the black man’s germs. My thought process is this. If we allow separate but equal, there is a chance that the equal part will not be enforced very diligently. Therefore, in order to justify your belief in separate but equal, you must explain what is wrong with allowing whites and colored people to eat at the same restaurant or sit next to one another on the bus. Whatever terrible thing it is that will happen to a white person who sits next to a black person on the bus, will that same bad thing happen to a white person who sits next to another white person on the bus? If you say no, how do you figure? Plessey V Ferguson was overturned in a case known as Brown V Board of Education. These days, most of us are amazed that anyone would think that a white person using the same public restroom as a black person is inherently harmful. 

Fifty years ago, most Americans felt that gay people should not be allowed to marry and adopt. Now, pretty much everyone who considers themselves liberal, is in favor of extending full equal rights to homosexuals. The percentage of Republicans, who oppose gay rights, is becoming smaller by the year. 

Fifty years from now, I am confident that those who oppose gay marriage will be seen the same way that people who oppose inter racial marriage are seen today. These people will still exist, but they will be a small minority of people and most of us will be amazed that anyone is or ever has been opposed to same sex marriage. After all, the purpose of laws is to protect people from harm. That is not to say that, just because a behavior has the potential to harm people, that it should necessarily be illegal. However, only if a behavior is potentially harmful should it be illegal. Any and all behaviors that do not have the potential to harm people should be legal. Therefore, laws stating that marriage licenses can only be issued to opposite sex couples and cannot be issued to same sex couples is fundamentally illogical for the same reason that it would be illogical to have a law prohibiting wearing a green shirt in public all the while it is totally legal to wear a red shirt in public. Anything (whether it be good, bad or neutral) that could happen as a result of wearing a green shirt in public, could also happen if you wear a red shirt in public. Therefore, if the situation and context is such that you are allowed to wear a red shirt in public, then you should be allowed to wear a green shirt in public. Similarly, anything (good, bad or neutral) that could happen if a same sex couple gets married, could also happen if a sterile heterosexual couple gets married. I added the qualifier that we are talking specifically about sterile heterosexual unions, because same sex unions are 100% sterile, while heterosexual unions do in fact carry with them the potential to create new life. If being sterile does not preclude you from marrying someone of the opposite sex and/or adopting a child, then same sex couples should also be allowed to marry and adopt.

Open a US history textbook and you may notice a trend that has occurred over the past 150 years. There is a group of people (women, gay people, racial minorities, etc.) who do not enjoy the same rights and protections under the law as others. There is controversy there. The issue really is as simple as; one side of the debate says that this group should enjoy the same rights and opportunities as everyone else, the other side believes that that group of people should be treated as second class citizens. The latter group’s entire argument is it is good when X group does it but yucky when Y group does it. The controversy really is as simple as that. When this happens, usually; A few people to the left of the political spectrum speak up and advocate for this positive change, but it seems unlikely that this change will ever occur. Year after year, more and more people on the political left not only advocate for it but attend marches and hold protests. Eventually, pretty much everyone on the left supports giving equal rights to this marginalized group, and the right is deeply divided on whether or not these people should enjoy equal rights. Decades later, we have reached a point where the vast majority of people (barring a very small minority of people) agree that the right in question should be granted to all people. It is amazing to most of us that this was ever controversial. 

Here are a few examples of what I mean. 

When the constitution was first ratified, women could not vote. Around the late 19th and early 20th century, a small minority of people began to entertain the thought that maybe women should vote. Most people (even women themselves) believed otherwise. Some people worried that women were too emotional to vote. To that I say; who is to say that being emotional automatically means that any vote you cast will be misguided. Some people felt that every woman would just vote the same as her husband. Not only is there a fairly decent chance that at least some women (maybe even a lot of women) would not vote the same way as their husbands, this argument fails to consider that unmarried people might vote. The social custom where women and children were to be the first ones rescued in a disaster was created to fuel the idea that women do not need to vote, because men will always prioritise women’s interests when voting. To that I say, women could also prioritize men’s best interests when voting. After all, every man who has ever voted would not have been able to vote if his mother had not given him life. Besides, women bring a unique perspective that men are not capable of bringing and vice versa. Even if men prioritize women’s best interests when voting, there may be certain things these men did not consider that a woman may have been more likely to consider. When the 19th amendment was ratified, a lot of people were mad about it. Nowadays, the vast majority of people agree that women should be allowed to vote. In fact, it seems kind of surprising that anyone would ever be against letting women vote. 

Throughout the first half of the 20th century, black where were oppressed by Jim Crow laws and other racist policies. In the supreme court case known as Plessey V Ferguson, it was ruled that, things that are for black people and things that are for white people could be separate, but they had to be equal. The problem of course is that a lot of the time, they where not equal. If you had one restaurant for whites and another for colored people, the bathrooms in the white restaurants would be cleaner, the cooks in the white restaurant would be more skilled and experienced, etc. Apparently, if a black man had just used the bathroom, there is something wrong with it. If a white man uses that same bathroom, the white man will become infected with the black man’s germs. My thought process is this. If we allow separate but equal, there is a chance that the equal part will not be enforced very diligently. Therefore, in order to justify your belief in separate but equal, you must explain what is wrong with allowing whites and colored people to eat at the same restaurant or sit next to one another on the bus. Whatever terrible thing it is that will happen to a white person who sits next to a black person on the bus, will that same bad thing happen to a white person who sits next to another white person on the bus? If you say no, how do you figure? Plessey V Ferguson was overturned in a case known as Brown V Board of Education. These days, most of us are amazed that anyone would think that a white person using the same public restroom as a black person is inherently harmful. 

Fifty years ago, most Americans felt that gay people should not be allowed to marry and adopt. Now, pretty much everyone who considers themselves liberal, is in favor of extending full equal rights to homosexuals. The percentage of Republicans, who oppose gay rights, is becoming smaller by the year. 

Fifty years from now, I am confident that those who oppose gay marriage will be seen the same way that people who oppose inter racial marriage are seen today. These people will still exist, but they will be a small minority of people and most of us will be amazed that anyone is or ever has been opposed to same sex marriage. After all, the purpose of laws is to protect people from harm. That is not to say that, just because a behavior has the potential to harm people, that it should necessarily be illegal. However, only if a behavior is potentially harmful should it be illegal. Any and all behaviors that do not have the potential to harm people should be legal. Therefore, laws stating that marriage licenses can only be issued to opposite sex couples and cannot be issued to same sex couples is fundamentally illogical for the same reason that it would be illogical to have a law prohibiting wearing a green shirt in public all the while it is totally legal to wear a red shirt in public. Anything (whether it be good, bad or neutral) that could happen as a result of wearing a green shirt in public, could also happen if you wear a red shirt in public. Therefore, if the situation and context is such that you are allowed to wear a red shirt in public, then you should be allowed to wear a green shirt in public. Similarly, anything (good, bad or neutral) that could happen if a same sex couple gets married, could also happen if a sterile heterosexual couple gets married. I added the qualifier that we are talking specifically about sterile heterosexual unions, because same sex unions are 100% sterile, while heterosexual unions do in fact carry with them the potential to create new life. If being sterile does not preclude you from marrying someone of the opposite sex and/or adopting a child, then same sex couples should also be allowed to marry and adopt.

After all, the purpose of laws is to protect people from harm. That is not to say that, just because a behavior has the potential to harm people, that it should necessarily be illegal. However, only if a behavior is potentially harmful should it be illegal. Any and all behaviors that do not have the potential to harm people should be legal. Therefore, laws stating that marriage licenses can only be issued to opposite sex couples and cannot be issued to same sex couples is fundamentally illogical for the same reason that it would be illogical to have a law prohibiting wearing a green shirt in public all the while it is totally legal to wear a red shirt in public. Anything (whether it be good, bad or neutral) that could happen as a result of wearing a green shirt in public, could also happen if you wear a red shirt in public. Therefore, if the situation and context is such that you are allowed to wear a red shirt in public, then you should be allowed to wear a green shirt in public. Similarly, anything (good, bad or neutral) that could happen if a same sex couple gets married, could also happen if a sterile heterosexual couple gets married. I added the qualifier that we are talking specifically about sterile heterosexual unions, because same sex unions are 100% sterile, while heterosexual unions do in fact carry with them the potential to create new life. If being sterile does not preclude you from marrying someone of the opposite sex and/or adopting a child, then same sex couples should also be allowed to marry and adopt.

Liberal,controversial,The Republican party appears to be becoming less homophobic.,"In 2020, the supreme court ruled that employment discrimination against gay people is unconstitutional. The reason behind this decision was as follows. If a man, who is in a relationship with another man, is subject to employment discrimination because he is in a relationship with a man, but a woman can be in a relationship with a man without facing any such discrimination, that is gender discrimination. Republican justices John Roberts and Neil Gorsuch (who were appointed by George W Bush and Donald Trump respectively) voted with the majority. Two Republican justices voted in favor of gay rights. 

Open a US history textbook and you may notice a trend that has occurred over the past 150 years. There is a group of people (women, gay people, racial minorities, etc.) who do not enjoy the same rights and protections under the law as others. There is controversy there. The issue really is as simple as; one side of the debate says that this group should enjoy the same rights and opportunities as everyone else, the other side believes that that group of people should be treated as second class citizens. The latter group’s entire argument is it is good when X group does it but yucky when Y group does it. The controversy really is as simple as that. When this happens, usually; A few people to the left of the political spectrum speak up and advocate for this positive change, but it seems unlikely that this change will ever occur. Year after year, more and more people on the political left not only advocate for it but attend marches and hold protests. Eventually, pretty much everyone on the left supports giving equal rights to this marginalized group, and the right is deeply divided on whether or not these people should enjoy equal rights. Decades later, we have reached a point where the vast majority of people (barring a very small minority of people) agree that the right in question should be granted to all people. It is amazing to most of us that this was ever controversial. 

Here are a few examples of what I mean. 

When the constitution was first ratified, women could not vote. Around the late 19th and early 20th century, a small minority of people began to entertain the thought that maybe women should vote. Most people (even women themselves) believed otherwise. Some people worried that women were too emotional to vote. To that I say; who is to say that being emotional automatically means that any vote you cast will be misguided. Some people felt that every woman would just vote the same as her husband. Not only is there a fairly decent chance that at least some women (maybe even a lot of women) would not vote the same way as their husbands, this argument fails to consider that unmarried people might vote. The social custom where women and children were to be the first ones rescued in a disaster was created to fuel the idea that women do not need to vote, because men will always prioritise women’s interests when voting. To that I say, women could also prioritize men’s best interests when voting. After all, every man who has ever voted would not have been able to vote if his mother had not given him life. Besides, women bring a unique perspective that men are not capable of bringing and vice versa. Even if men prioritize women’s best interests when voting, there may be certain things these men did not consider that a woman may have been more likely to consider. When the 19th amendment was ratified, a lot of people were mad about it. Nowadays, the vast majority of people agree that women should be allowed to vote. In fact, it seems kind of surprising that anyone would ever be against letting women vote. 

Throughout the first half of the 20th century, black where were oppressed by Jim Crow laws and other racist policies. In the supreme court case known as Plessey V Ferguson, it was ruled that, things that are for black people and things that are for white people could be separate, but they had to be equal. The problem of course is that a lot of the time, they where not equal. If you had one restaurant for whites and another for colored people, the bathrooms in the white restaurants would be cleaner, the cooks in the white restaurant would be more skilled and experienced, etc. Apparently, if a black man had just used the bathroom, there is something wrong with it. If a white man uses that same bathroom, the white man will become infected with the black man’s germs. My thought process is this. If we allow separate but equal, there is a chance that the equal part will not be enforced very diligently. Therefore, in order to justify your belief in separate but equal, you must explain what is wrong with allowing whites and colored people to eat at the same restaurant or sit next to one another on the bus. Whatever terrible thing it is that will happen to a white person who sits next to a black person on the bus, will that same bad thing happen to a white person who sits next to another white person on the bus? If you say no, how do you figure? Plessey V Ferguson was overturned in a case known as Brown V Board of Education. These days, most of us are amazed that anyone would think that a white person using the same public restroom as a black person is inherently harmful. 

Fifty years ago, most Americans felt that gay people should not be allowed to marry and adopt. Now, pretty much everyone who considers themselves liberal, is in favor of extending full equal rights to homosexuals. The percentage of Republicans, who oppose gay rights, is becoming smaller by the year. 

Fifty years from now, I am confident that those who oppose gay marriage will be seen the same way that people who oppose inter racial marriage are seen today. These people will still exist, but they will be a small minority of people and most of us will be amazed that anyone is or ever has been opposed to same sex marriage. After all, the purpose of laws is to protect people from harm. That is not to say that, just because a behavior has the potential to harm people, that it should necessarily be illegal.

",0,0,0,"In 2024, 83% of democrats supported gay marriage. 74% of independents. Only 46% of republicans did. And that's DOWN from the 55% of republicans that supported it in 2021 and 2022. It's even down since 2017. So they are not only lagging way behind, but they've actually gone backwards in recent years.

Saying that republicans are ""becoming less"" homophobic -- which was your original post -- is technically accurate if you want to go back 8 years and compare the data. So if that's all you want out of this, fine. But they are nowhere close to being considered ""not homophobic.""  It's like saying we're making progress on the cancer fight. Okay, but it's still the second-leading cause of death in the U.S.

We should also point out that when same-sex marriage was made a federal protection in 2022, only 12 out of 48 republicans in the senate voted in support of it. 36 out of 48 said no. I'm not exactly ready to hand out any kudos to them for showing love and tolerance.

Lastly, there are still like 32 states that have laws on the books banning gay marriage. Why haven't they been removed? So that if the federal protection gets overturned, it will go back to being illegal again in those states. And take a wild guess at how many of those are red states? If you guessed all of them, you would be correct.",1,2025-02-03 09:23:06,2025-02-03 20:58:55,0.9

It’s hard to understand this until you’ve been sucked into a variety of online echo chambers. Until that happens, most people believe their original point of view to be absolute truth. Chances are, this guy just consumes different media than you.

Very few people are able to deeply discuss politics, bills, specific policies, etc. As a result, they cling to the personality traits of candidates. Those in favor of Trump like that he’s unfiltered and disrupts the status quo. Those who don’t like him, dislike him for the same reason.

The chances of your neighbor’s affinity with Trump running deeper than “he owns the libs” is extremely low. He probably views that sign like a sports teams’ logo.

I lean liberal but live in a very conservative city. Most of my clients are conservative and I just avoid talking politics with them.

Yeah, mostly. By the early 60s, it would be more accurate to say that the Democrats constituted an unholy alliance of pro-civil rights northern liberals that would be recognizable to us today, like Hubert Humphrey, and southern segregationist conservatives that would fit right with with the modern GOP like Richard Russell and Strom Thurmond (who was a Democrat before switching in 1964). These two groups were really only united by economic policies, but that had already begun to erode as well, which would give Reagan the opening to take the Dixiecrat vote in 1980.  

The GOP, at the same time, was also at war with itself. There was a strong liberal faction led by Governor Nelson Rockefeller of New York, and a rising conservative faction led by Barry Goldwater. 

1960 may well have been the tipping point for both both parties. If Nixon, who ran as a moderate, had won in 1960, the Republicans might have remained the more liberal party and the Democrats might have become even more beholden to their conservative southern wing.",5,2024-11-21 05:36:22,2024-11-21 16:45:29,0.0

That is a result of the psychological conditioning that Republicans have engaged in against American voters for decades. They have been relentless in creating mistrust in government, mistrust in experts, and teaching people to believe that Democrats are crazy, corrupt, radical liberals.

Sure there are some bad apples in the Democratic Party. Sure, the Democratic Party is sometimes dysfunctional, because democracy is supposed to be messy. 

For the notion that Democratic political leaders are largely ""pieces of shit"" comes from that propaganda, and a misunderstanding of how democracy works.

Would you let a group of people just skip the line and cut in front of everyone at a grocery store?",0,0,0,"Several are the reasons as why we need some amount of illegals in the country at any one time.

For 1,

There's several high level and high end workers that are needed in different fields. These generally stay over from college visas. But run a vast array of important improvements that can only be gained by how that person can view the problem.

The second is those that come over for higher work types, but make the choice to have families. Those families have kids, those kids become trained workers in our economy.

And it goes down the chain from high end to lowest end.

Every section of the economy is affected. 

Not every illegal is Latino in origin. Although most Latinos fill perhaps the most important roll.

Our food supply. 

From Beef, Pork, Chicken, all field crops, all small growth crops, fruit crops and nut crops are attend by those workers.

It's how smaller farmers can make enough money to make things profitable.

Americans (legal) aren't going to go and pick strawberries out of strawberry patch all day. Nor feed the chickens, clean the chickens, care for those damn chickens.

Farmers cannot afford to pay enough money to interest ANY American to do it. 

So many aspects of our lives involve the idea of illegal immigrants.

Now, the issue has turn to ALL illegal immigrants =s criminals and drug dealers, child traffickers and all kinds of crime.

But there's always a bad portion of people, from any topic. The total amount of crimes committed is extremely low when compared to normal ""Americans"".

Should people wait? Yes. Ideally.

But the heart of the matter is an overall framework and rework of the current laws to deal with modern challenges.

Not order in the troops.

When you order in the troops, people die. A lot of people. The Armed Forces are weapons to be used to destroy our enemies, kill them. Completely destroy. That's what troops do afterall.

Liberal,controversial,The assassination of Charlie Kirk is antithetical of - and regressive to - securing liberal values,"The assassination of Charlie Kirk today is an immense tragedy, striking at liberal values and at the goal of a peaceful, prosperous society for all. Speaking as someone who is ideologically liberal - freedom of debate is a core tenet of classical liberal values. When ideas cannot be debated freely, violence becomes inevitable.

*“He that would make his own liberty secure must guard even his enemy from oppression; for if he violates this duty he establishes a precedent that will reach to himself.”* – Thomas Paine

I disagree vehemently with most all of Kirk’s ideas and found them reprehensible and extremely harmful to our society, and yet I feel a deep sadness today—most of all for the effect this violence will have on our society. While we do not yet know who the killer is or their motives, it needs to be said that the murder of this man for political reasons is completely antithetical to liberal values, and this act does immense harm to the spread of those values within our society—both ethically and politically.

When someone hears the word “liberal,” it is often assumed to mean a Democrat. That is not how I use the word to define myself. Classical liberalism is bigger than party lines. It is rooted in liberty itself—the freedom to speak, to argue, and to live freely even in disagreement.

Charlie Kirk was very effective at being divisive, spewing hateful things about groups of people, and advocating for ideas that are antithetical to liberty. His death will be used by some as an excuse to push for more hatred, fear, and oppression. As we move forward, we must keep in mind that there will be destructive voices on both sides of political discourse.

That is the stuff that starts driving sectarian violence versus a notion that one has to live among others who are different from them thus you have to be tolerant to a degree of people who you disagree with.


I find it fascinating when we attach ""religion"" to it that we are much more tolerant of beliefs we disagree with as can be seen by all the religious exemptions we offer people.  


We need to reinvigerate the notion of liberty and people living in the manner which they want as long as they are not directly harming others. Too much morality policing and trying to use state authority to reinforce ideologies.


With that said, Charie was aligned to to utterly destroy the livelihoods and retirements of a few thousand Trans military members.  He was not committed to freedom and self determination as seen by that one example.

Liberal,controversial,"Temporary abortion compromise, followed immediately by massive electoral reform","I suggest we should look at this election loss from a perspective of vote-splitting. It's not the only valid perspective, but there are lessons here.

We can approximate the country into four quadrants divided along two axes: pro-life/pro-choice, pro-democracy/anti-democracy. The pro-choice/pro-democracy party is the institutional Democratic Party. The pro-life/pro-democracy people explicitly aren't allowed in that club, because the Party refuses to (as they would put it) compromise on women's rights, and the pro-life crowd won't compromise on the issue either. The anti-democracy people are the institutional Republican Party, and were able to work together better regardless of their pro-life/pro-choice stance. So now we have effectively three parties, in a system built for two, and vote-splitting screws the entire pro-democracy camp.

The correct solution is for the Democratic Party to compromise on the pro-life/pro-choice axis, on an *explicitly temporary* basis. Allow pro-life candidates back into the party, on the condition that once the Democratic Party gains power in any state or at a federal level, it should immediately begin a defined program of massive systematic reform, which includes reforms that make the system function with more than two parties. (No more first-past-the-post, approval voting FTW, among other solutions.) After that, the pro-life and pro-choice wings can safely part ways, but still opportunistically cooperate, without handing the entire government over to the fascists.

The GOP became the party of Trump due to vote-splitting; he won the 2016 primary with only 40% of the votes cast. The GOP didn't fix the problem, they doubled down. Can the Democrats instead learn the lesson that the fundamental problem is our election systems, and until that gets fixed, nothing else will?",0,0,0,So your answer is segregation?

1. Tapping into the innate fear humans have of the “other” (strangers/immigrants, people of color, women, LGBTQ, etc.) to keep Americans divided and less powerful. 

2. Tapping into religious groups that are programmed not to question what they are told, no matter how nonsensical. 

3. Destroying the educational system so citizens are ignorant of how our government works, of foreign affairs, of American history, of critical thinking - and promoting social media that lauds stupidity. 

4. Keeping workers underpaid, having their health insurance tied to their job, and destroying unions that would keep workers from teetering on the edge of destitution. 

5. Implementing a business model where profit is king, jobs are outsourced, and workers are disposable - destroying the middle class and creating rust belts throughout the country. 

6. Buying elected officials, the Supreme Court, and backing misinformation/propaganda mills like Fox et al. 

We are now at the fruition of all their efforts. Trump is a buffoon figurehead messiah for the masses to follow. The oligarchs backed him because he is stupid and easily manipulated with praise. What the oligarchs plan to do is pillage the American storehouses by privatizing education, social security, Medicare, Medicaid, any anything else that has a pool of money they can grab.

However it's more complicated than that, it's not just a simple majority vote like when Congress is in session, each state's representatives vote together. For example, a representative from Iowa would not just vote for who they want to be President they would get together with all the other Iowan representatives, and whichever candidate the majority votes for would get Iowa's vote.

In this scenario even if the Democrats win the House and have a majority to vote they most likely would not have a majority representative in a majority of states and Trump would still win the House vote...just another thing to worry about

But the Hous only decides the President, the Senate would then choose the VP and I believe that is done by a simple majority. So if Democrats hold the Senate and no one candidate gets to 270 we could be looking at a Trump-Walz White House or even a Trump-Harris White House (if the Senate decided to pick her over Walz as VP)",40,2024-11-04 22:16:32,2024-11-04 22:30:55,0

Liberal,controversial,The Dred Scott case has no relevance to the second amendment,"It’s my understanding that gun advocates sometimes use the 1857 *Dred Scott v. Sandford* ([link](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/60/393/#tab-opinion-1964281)) decision to make the argument that the second amendment guarantees an individual right to own guns.  Just a few examples of 2A advocates making this argument are [this video](https://youtu.be/2W8sppSylVU?si=Nc8sFW1RGujByEjl&t=129), [this video](https://youtu.be/neLdsW7XZSM?si=5wz8HCrInl1s6KCi&t=605), and [this video](https://youtu.be/6vglHW9q2Ek?si=DUs36IP8dXJ6Sp6G&t=101), as well as written examples such as these: [link 1](https://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=345),[ link 2](https://www.law.georgetown.edu/mcrp-journal/blog/the-second-amendment-is-racist-why-bruen-should-have-been-decided-on-equal-protection-grounds/),[ link 3](https://harvardlawreview.org/forum/vol-135/racist-gun-laws-and-the-second-amendment/).  In fact, even Justice Clarence Thomas connects *Dred Scott* to the second amendment in his opinion for *NYSRPA vs Bruen* ([link](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/597/20-843/#tab-opinion-4600259)).  Most of their argument seems to stem from this excerpt from the opinion in that case written by Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney:

>More especially, it cannot be believed that the large slaveholding States regarded them as included in the word citizens, or would have consented to a Constitution which might compel them to receive them in that character from another State. For if they were so received, and entitled to the privileges and immunities of citizens, it would exempt them from the operation of the special laws and from the police regulations which they considered to be necessary for their own safety. **It would give to persons of the negro race, who were recognised as citizens in any one State of the Union, the right to enter every other State whenever they pleased, singly or in companies, without pass or passport, and without obstruction, to sojourn there as long as they pleased, to go where they pleased at every hour of the day or night without molestation, unless they committed some violation of law for which a white man would be punished; and it would give them the full liberty of speech in public and in private upon all subjects upon which its own citizens might speak; to hold public meetings upon political affairs, and to keep and carry arms wherever they went.** And all of this would be done in the face of the subject race of the same color, both free and slaves, and inevitably producing discontent and insubordination among them, and endangering the peace and safety of the State.

The portion I’ve put in bold appears to be what some argue is a synopsis of the federal Bill of Rights, and the statement saying “and to keep and carry arms wherever they went” appears to be a reference to the second amendment.  Gun advocates would argue that if the Supreme Court in 1857 believed that the second amendment guaranteed a citizen an individual right to keep and carry a gun, then this must also have been the traditional and authentic interpretation of that amendment.

However, I don’t understand how this argument is valid.  It seems to me that one could only come to the aforementioned conclusion if one has not actually read the context in which the above paragraph appears.  Earlier, Justice Taney had begun his opinion by presenting a list of state laws which placed explicit restrictions upon the rights and privileges of the black populations of the respective states.  These laws dated from colonial times through to the then-present day.  Taney’s reasoning was essentially that it made no sense for a “negro” that was a slave or a descendant of slaves imported from Africa to become a citizen, because the sum of all of the discriminatory and prohibitive laws that had been passed against the black populations strongly indicates that it had been the general will of the individual states to subjugate the black populations in the interest of public peace and security.  And when the individual states ratified the Constitution in order to join into a union under a federal government, the individual states vested to the federal government the protection of their peace and safety; and thus, it would be inappropriate for the federal government to betray this trust by giving citizenship to a demographic which the individual states themselves had seen fit to subjugate.  

 Among the list of discriminatory laws he mentions, the first is a 1717 law from Maryland which declared

>”that if any free negro or mulatto intermarry with any white woman, or if any white man shall intermarry with any negro or mulatto woman, such negro or mulatto shall become a slave during life, excepting mulattoes born of white women, who, for such intermarriage, shall only become servants for seven years, to be disposed of as the justices of the county court where such marriage so happens shall think fit, to be applied by them towards the support of a public school within the said county. And any white man or white woman who shall intermarry as aforesaid with any negro or mulatto, such white man or white woman shall become servants during the term of seven years, and shall be disposed of by the justices as aforesaid, and be applied to the uses aforesaid.""

 Then he mentions a 1705 Massachusetts law which declared that

>""if any negro or mulatto shall presume to smite or strike any person of the English or other Christian nation, such negro or mulatto shall be severely whipped, at the discretion of the justices before whom the offender shall be convicted.""

 And another law from the same state declares

>""that none of her Majesty's English or Scottish subjects, nor of any other Christian nation, within this province, shall contract matrimony with any negro or mulatto; nor shall any person, duly authorized to solemnize marriage, presume to join any such in marriage, on pain of forfeiting the sum of fifty pounds; one moiety thereof to her Majesty, for and towards the support of the Government within this province, and the other moiety to him or them that shall inform and sue for the same, in any of her Majesty's courts of record within the province, by bill, plaint, or information.""

 He later on mentions a 1774 Connecticut provision

>by which any negro, Indian, or mulatto servant who was found wandering out of the town or place to which he belonged without a written pass such as is therein described was made liable to be seized by anyone, and taken before the next authority to be examined and delivered up to his master -- who was required to pay the charge which had accrued thereby. And a subsequent section of the same law provides that if any free negro shall travel without such pass, and shall be stopped, seized, or taken up, he shall pay all charges arising thereby. And this law was in full operation when the Constitution of the United States was adopted, and was not repealed till 1797. So that, up to that time, free negroes and mulattoes were associated with servants and slaves in the police regulations established by the laws of the State.

 And then another Connecticut law in 1833 which…

>made it penal to set up or establish any school in that State for the instruction of persons of the African race not inhabitants of the State, or to instruct or teach in any such school or institution, or board or harbor for that purpose, any such person without the previous consent in writing of the civil authority of the town in which such school or institution might be.

 Justice Taney mentions a provision in New Hampshire  in 1815, in which

>no one was permitted to be enrolled in the militia of the State but free white citizens, and the same provision is found in a subsequent collection of the laws made in 1855. Nothing could more strongly mark the entire repudiation of the African race. The alien is excluded because, being born in a foreign country, he cannot be a member of the community until he is naturalized. But why are the African race, born in the State, not permitted to share in one of the highest duties of the citizen? The answer is obvious; he is not, by the institutions and laws of the State, numbered among its people. He forms no part of the sovereignty of the State, and is not therefore called on to uphold and defend it.

 And finally he mentions an 1822 Rhode Island law

>forbidding persons who were authorized to join persons in marriage from joining in marriage any white person with any negro, Indian, or mulatto, under the penalty of two hundred dollars, and declaring all such marriages absolutely null and void, and the same law was again reenacted in its revised code of 1844. So that, down to the last-mentioned period, the strongest mark of inferiority and degradation was fastened upon the African race in that State.

 It is after his list of such restrictive and discriminatory laws that Justice Taney extrapolates that if it was the will of the states to exclude the black population from the status of citizenship within each of their respective dominions, then it is only appropriate that the same demographic be excluded from citizenship by the national government into which the respective states had vested their collective interests.  As Taney states,

>For if they were so received, and entitled to the privileges and immunities of citizens, it would exempt them from the operation of the special laws and from the police regulations which they considered to be necessary for their own safety.

 And then it is here where Taney states the excerpt which pro-gun advocates so often emphasize:

>It would give to persons of the negro race, who were recognised as citizens in any one State of the Union, the right to enter every other State whenever they pleased, singly or in companies, without pass or passport, and without obstruction, to sojourn there as long as they pleased, to go where they pleased at every hour of the day or night without molestation, unless they committed some violation of law for which a white man would be punished; and it would give them the full liberty of speech in public and in private upon all subjects upon which its own citizens might speak; to hold public meetings upon political affairs, *and to keep and carry arms wherever they went*.

Upon looking at the larger context of this excerpt, it would seem that the excerpt doesn’t actually mean what the pro-gun advocates interpret it to mean.  First of all, it would seem that some of the items within this excerpt correlate with the prohibitive laws previously mentioned.  The first is when he mentions “the right to enter every other State whenever they pleased . . . without pass or passport . . . .”  This correlates with the aforementioned 1774 Connecticut provision that required people of color to carry a pass when wandering outside the town of their residence.  And the second correlated item is -- in my interpretation -- the infamous line “and to keep and carry arms wherever they went”.   I understand this line to be an allusion to the 1815 New Hampshire law which limited the right of militia duty to only free white citizens of the state.   

Gun-rights advocates would likely interpret the latter line to refer to the text of the second amendment, and to refer to an individual right to own and carry guns for private purposes, such as self defense or sport.  However, it makes no sense for the line “to keep and carry arms wherever they went” to refer to the text of the second amendment.  Even though this line may sound similar to the line “the right of the people to keep and bear arms”, they are not the same, and the differences between the two are not at all negligible.  First of all, the second amendment refers to the right to “bear arms”, while the line from *Dred Scott* says “carry arms”.  The modern reader may simply see these two phrases as synonymous, but they are not.  The meaning of “carry arms” is straightforward, consisting of a transitive verb acting upon a noun; but the phrase “bear arms” does not actually refer to the carrying of arms, but rather is itself a phrasal verb and an idiomatic expression.  According to the Oxford English Dictionary -- the most authoritative resource on the English language -- the expression “bear arms” originated around AD 1325, and is correlated with the Latin phrase *arma ferre*, likely being simply a direct translation of the Latin.  Also according to the Oxford English Dictionary, the phrase is defined simply as “To serve as a soldier; to fight (for a country, cause, etc.).”  The sense of the phrase ""the right to bear arms"" in the sense that pro-gun advocates typically use the phrase is, according to the Oxford dictionary, an originally and chiefly American re-definition of the phrase, originating circa 1776.  Hence, the second amendment references the right of the people to keep arms and *to fight* and/or *serve as a soldier*; while the *Dred Scott* line instead references the right to keep arms and carry arms.  

Furthermore, the *Dred Scott* line also differs from the second amendment by including the modifier “wherever they went”.  No such modifier exists in the second amendment.  In fact, the second amendment is merely a prohibitive provision, one which is applied against Congress itself, and does not directly apply any affirmative granting of rights to the people.  It makes no sense to interpret an absolute prohibition against Congress as somehow establishing a modified affirming of rights to the people.  Because of these linguistic and textual details, it is, at best, quite a stretch to claim that the phrase “and to keep and carry arms wherever they went” is somehow a meaningful reference to the second amendment.

Some might alternatively argue that the line, rather than referring to the text of the second amendment specifically, is instead referring to the liberty of private gun use in general.  But what makes much more sense is that the line “and to keep and carry arms wherever they went”, instead of referring to private gun use, actually refers to militia duty.  It was customary in early America for militiamen to possess arms -- such as muskets or rifles -- in their personal custody (i.e. “to keep arms”), and to literally carry them wherever they went.  We can see evidence of this from numerous militia-related laws from early America from colonial times until the 20th century.  On example is a New York law from 1640:

>ORDINANCE

>Of the Director and Council of New Netherland, providing for the Arming and mustering of the Militia in case of danger. Passed 9 May, 1640.

>\[N.Y. Col. MSS. IV. 61.\]

>The Honble Director and Council have considered it advisable to ordain that the Inhabitants residing at and around Fort Amsterdam, of what state, quality or condition soever they be, *shall each provide himself with a good gun and keep the same in good repair and at all times ready and in order*; and as they live at a distance the one from the other, every warned person is placed under his Corporal in order that in time of danger he may appear at his post with his gun. Should it happen, which God forbid, that any mischief occur either from enemies or traitors at night, the people will be notified by the discharge of three cannon fired in quick succession; and if by day, means will be found to give warning to every one, who is commanded thereupon to repair instantly to his Corporal at the place appointed and then to adopt such measures as the exigency of the case shall require, on pain of being fined Fifty guilders. \[[link](https://firearmslaw.duke.edu/laws/1640-n-y-laws-23-ordinance-of-the-director-and-council-of-new-netherland-providing-for-the-arming-and-mustering-of-the-militia-in-case-of-danger)\]

 A Delaware law from 1782:

>And be it Enacted, That every Person between the Ages of eighteen and fifty, or who may hereafter attain to the Age of eighteen Years (Clergymen and Preachers of the Gospel of every Denomination, Judges of the Supreme Court, Sheriffs, Keepers of the public Gaols, School-Masters teaching a Latin School, or having at least twenty English Scholars, and indented Servants bona Fide purchased, excepted) who is rated at Six Pounds, or upwards, towards the Payment of public Taxes, shall, at his own Expence, provide himself; and every Apprentice, or other Person, of the Age of eighteen and under twenty-one Years who hath an Estate of the Value of Eighty Pounds, or whose Parent is rated at Eighteen Pounds towards the public Taxes, shall, by his Parent or Guardian, respectively, be provided with a Musket or Firelock with a Bayonet, a Cartouch-Box to contain twenty-three Cartridges, a Priming-Wire, a Brush and six Flints, all in good Order, on or before the first Day of June next, *and shall keep the same by him at all Times, ready and fit for Service*, under the Penalty of Twenty Shillings for every two Months Neglect or Default, to be paid by such Person, if of full Age, or by the Parent or Guardian of such as are under twenty-one Years, the same Arms and Accoutrements to be charged by the Guardian to his Ward, and allowed at settling the Accounts of his Guardianship. \[[link](https://firearmslaw.duke.edu/laws/1782-del-acts-3-an-act-for-establishing-a-militia-within-this-state-c2a7-6)\]

And here are a few more links to other similar militia laws:

[1642 Virginia](https://firearmslaw.duke.edu/laws/1642-va-acts-263-acts-of-march-2nd-1642-act-xli)

So it would seem that with a deeper understanding of the workings of the militia during early American history, the modifier “wherever they went” should more sensibly be correlated with the common practices surrounding compulsory militia service, rather than being correlated with any sort of voluntary liberty of carrying arms for private purposes.  

The connection that the pro-gun community makes between *Dred Scott* and the second amendment is tenuous at best.  Within the passage in bold from *Dred Scott*, there are four stated civil rights: the right to travel freely without a pass, the right to freedom of speech, the right to hold public meetings on political issues, and the right to keep and carry arms.  Of these four rights, only one of them can be said to correlate directly to the Bill of Rights: the right of freedom of speech.  The rest have no connection to the Bill of Rights.  And to assume that the phrase “to keep and carry arms” is directly related to the second amendment is a stretch, since the language between the two statements has only a superficial correlation.  These stated civil rights in bold do not represent the contents of the Bill of Rights, and thus cannot be interpreted as a general reference to that document; and the phrase “to keep and carry arms wherever they went” does not represent the second amendment directly; for these reasons, there is simply no argument that this passage from *Dred Scott* supports second amendment rights.   

Of the four stated civil rights, it would appear that Justice Taney mentions two of them as allusions to previously mentioned statutes: the line “and to keep and carry arms wherever they went” correlates to the aforementioned 1815 New Hampshire militia law which excluded black people from militia service; and an even more obvious connection is made between the line “the right to enter every other State whenever they pleased . . . without pass or passport” and the 1774 Connecticut law requiring black people to carry a pass while traveling.  

The other two stated civil rights -- freedom of speech and the right to hold public meetings -- appear to be outliers of this pattern, as they appear to have been mentioned without any aforementioned precedent in state law.  However, there might still be a particular reason why Justice Taney saw fit to mention these particular rights.  It so happens that most of the items listed in the bolded excerpt are also stipulated in the Declaration of Rights in the 1820 Missouri State Constitution.  This is especially relevant since the *Dred Scott* case centered on whether the plaintiff was still considered a slave in the slave state of Missouri after having gained his freedom after traveling to the free state of Illinois.  Notably, the two outlier items are also addressed in the Missouri Constitution.

The statement from *Dred Scott* which says “and it would give them the full liberty of speech in public and in private upon all subjects upon which its own citizens might speak” appears to correlate with Article 13, Clause 16:

>That the free communication of thoughts and opinions is one of the invaluable rights of man, and that every person may freely speak, write, and print, on any subject, being responsible for the abuse of that liberty.

 And the statement “to hold public meetings upon political affairs” appears to correlate with Article 13, Clause 2:

>That the people of this state have the inherent, sole, and exclusive right of regulating the internal government and police thereof, and of altering and abolishing their constitution and form of government, whenever it may be necessary to their safety and happiness.

Furthermore, in addition to their connection to the discriminatory laws already established within the text of *Dred Scott*, the remaining two items from the excerpt also appear to have correlates in the Missouri Constitution as well.  The statement about the right of a citizen “to enter every other State whenever they pleased” appears to correlate with a clause in Article 3, section 26:

>It shall be their \[the general assembly’s\] duty, as soon as may be, to pass such laws as may be necessary--1. To prevent free negroes and mulattoes from coming to and settling in this State, under any pretext whatsoever;

 And it also seems to correlate with Article 13, Clause 21:

> That migration from this state cannot be prohibited.

And the statement “and to keep and carry arms wherever they went” appears to correlate with the state arms provision in part of Article 13, Clause 3:

>that their right to bear arms, in defense of themselves and of the state, cannot be questioned.

Compared to the second amendment, this arms provision in the Missouri Constitution seems more pertinent to the arms statement mentioned in the *Dred Scott* decision, since this provision specifically qualifies the lawful purposes for which the right to bear arms may be exercised, which the second amendment does not do.

**Conclusion**

Some might say that it only makes sense that Justice Taney is referring to the federal Bill of Rights in the bolded excerpt because he is speaking on behalf of the United States Supreme Court, which is a federal body.  However, this interpretation is uninformed.  When we look at the actual context of the *Dred Scott* decision, it is clear that the particular point that Justice Taney is making in that excerpt pertains much more to state law than to federal law.  Even though the decision that Justice Taney is making is a federal decision, he is clearly making this federal decision based on state premises.

It has never been the primary prerogative of the federal government to grant rights to American citizens.  It is state governments that have the primary authority and function of specifying and granting civil rights.  Hence, Justice Taney wasn't saying that making black people into citizens -- at the federal level -- would give them rights; his point was that federally making black people into citizens would effectively negate the prohibitive laws that the states have established in order to subjugate their black populations.  In other words, making black people into citizens would create a kind of ""double negative"" whose effect is a positive: it would not actually give them anything, but instead would *take away* the laws that *take away* their liberties.  The verbiage ""it would *give* to persons of the negro race..."" is hence metaphorical rather than literal.  It's like if a judge were to exonerate a convicted prison inmate through DNA evidence: the judge isn't actually *giving* the inmate his freedom; the judge is just *removing* his incarceration.  Thus, it is merely the result of a quirk of language and rhetoric that Justice Taney *appears* to be affirming that American citizens are entitled to the liberty to keep and carry arms wherever they go.  But for gun advocates to take this rhetoric literally, as they often do, is simply a wrong conclusion to draw

As for the content of the bolded excerpt, I can’t say how purposeful or how arbitrary this particular assortment of rights was meant to be.  At least two of the four items appear to be references to state laws which he had previously referenced, yet he breaks this pattern with the other two items, which do not have any statutory precursor in *Dred Scott*; and there are even more state laws referenced earlier that he *does not* allude to in the bolded list.  And furthermore, all of the items in the list could be said to have correlates in the 1820 Missouri Constitution; but it is not clear whether Justice Taney was actually alluding to that constitution in particular -- because of its relevance to the case at hand, or if he was referencing any other state constitution.  In summary, I don’t know exactly why Justice Taney chose the particular list of items that he chose in the bolded excerpt of his majority opinion in *Dred Scott*; however, I can say with much more confidence what this excerpt *does not* indicate.  He is not referencing the federal Bill of Rights as a whole; he is not referencing the second amendment in particular; and he is likely not referencing the general liberty of private firearm rights.  Therefore, there is no basis for pro-gun advocates to use this case as a means to argue for firearm rights.

Liberal,controversial,The Dred Scott case has no relevance to the second amendment,"It’s my understanding that gun advocates sometimes use the 1857 *Dred Scott v. Sandford* ([link](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/60/393/#tab-opinion-1964281)) decision to make the argument that the second amendment guarantees an individual right to own guns.  Just a few examples of 2A advocates making this argument are [this video](https://youtu.be/2W8sppSylVU?si=Nc8sFW1RGujByEjl&t=129), [this video](https://youtu.be/neLdsW7XZSM?si=5wz8HCrInl1s6KCi&t=605), and [this video](https://youtu.be/6vglHW9q2Ek?si=DUs36IP8dXJ6Sp6G&t=101), as well as written examples such as these: [link 1](https://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=345),[ link 2](https://www.law.georgetown.edu/mcrp-journal/blog/the-second-amendment-is-racist-why-bruen-should-have-been-decided-on-equal-protection-grounds/),[ link 3](https://harvardlawreview.org/forum/vol-135/racist-gun-laws-and-the-second-amendment/).  In fact, even Justice Clarence Thomas connects *Dred Scott* to the second amendment in his opinion for *NYSRPA vs Bruen* ([link](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/597/20-843/#tab-opinion-4600259)).  Most of their argument seems to stem from this excerpt from the opinion in that case written by Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney:

>More especially, it cannot be believed that the large slaveholding States regarded them as included in the word citizens, or would have consented to a Constitution which might compel them to receive them in that character from another State. For if they were so received, and entitled to the privileges and immunities of citizens, it would exempt them from the operation of the special laws and from the police regulations which they considered to be necessary for their own safety. **It would give to persons of the negro race, who were recognised as citizens in any one State of the Union, the right to enter every other State whenever they pleased, singly or in companies, without pass or passport, and without obstruction, to sojourn there as long as they pleased, to go where they pleased at every hour of the day or night without molestation, unless they committed some violation of law for which a white man would be punished; and it would give them the full liberty of speech in public and in private upon all subjects upon which its own citizens might speak; to hold public meetings upon political affairs, and to keep and carry arms wherever they went.** And all of this would be done in the face of the subject race of the same color, both free and slaves, and inevitably producing discontent and insubordination among them, and endangering the peace and safety of the State.

The portion I’ve put in bold appears to be what some argue is a synopsis of the federal Bill of Rights, and the statement saying “and to keep and carry arms wherever they went” appears to be a reference to the second amendment.  Gun advocates would argue that if the Supreme Court in 1857 believed that the second amendment guaranteed a citizen an individual right to keep and carry a gun, then this must also have been the traditional and authentic interpretation of that amendment.

However, I don’t understand how this argument is valid.  It seems to me that one could only come to the aforementioned conclusion if one has not actually read the context in which the above paragraph appears.  Earlier, Justice Taney had begun his opinion by presenting a list of state laws which placed explicit restrictions upon the rights and privileges of the black populations of the respective states.  These laws dated from colonial times through to the then-present day.  Taney’s reasoning was essentially that it made no sense for a “negro” that was a slave or a descendant of slaves imported from Africa to become a citizen, because the sum of all of the discriminatory and prohibitive laws that had been passed against the black populations strongly indicates that it had been the general will of the individual states to subjugate the black populations in the interest of public peace and security.  And when the individual states ratified the Constitution in order to join into a union under a federal government, the individual states vested to the federal government the protection of their peace and safety; and thus, it would be inappropriate for the federal government to betray this trust by giving citizenship to a demographic which the individual states themselves had seen fit to subjugate.  

 Among the list of discriminatory laws he mentions, the first is a 1717 law from Maryland which declared

>”that if any free negro or mulatto intermarry with any white woman, or if any white man shall intermarry with any negro or mulatto woman, such negro or mulatto shall become a slave during life, excepting mulattoes born of white women, who, for such intermarriage, shall only become servants for seven years, to be disposed of as the justices of the county court where such marriage so happens shall think fit, to be applied by them towards the support of a public school within the said county. And any white man or white woman who shall intermarry as aforesaid with any negro or mulatto, such white man or white woman shall become servants during the term of seven years, and shall be disposed of by the justices as aforesaid, and be applied to the uses aforesaid.""

 Then he mentions a 1705 Massachusetts law which declared that

>""if any negro or mulatto shall presume to smite or strike any person of the English or other Christian nation, such negro or mulatto shall be severely whipped, at the discretion of the justices before whom the offender shall be convicted.""

 And another law from the same state declares

>""that none of her Majesty's English or Scottish subjects, nor of any other Christian nation, within this province, shall contract matrimony with any negro or mulatto; nor shall any person, duly authorized to solemnize marriage, presume to join any such in marriage, on pain of forfeiting the sum of fifty pounds; one moiety thereof to her Majesty, for and towards the support of the Government within this province, and the other moiety to him or them that shall inform and sue for the same, in any of her Majesty's courts of record within the province, by bill, plaint, or information.""

 He later on mentions a 1774 Connecticut provision

>by which any negro, Indian, or mulatto servant who was found wandering out of the town or place to which he belonged without a written pass such as is therein described was made liable to be seized by anyone, and taken before the next authority to be examined and delivered up to his master -- who was required to pay the charge which had accrued thereby. And a subsequent section of the same law provides that if any free negro shall travel without such pass, and shall be stopped, seized, or taken up, he shall pay all charges arising thereby. And this law was in full operation when the Constitution of the United States was adopted, and was not repealed till 1797. So that, up to that time, free negroes and mulattoes were associated with servants and slaves in the police regulations established by the laws of the State.

 And then another Connecticut law in 1833 which…

>made it penal to set up or establish any school in that State for the instruction of persons of the African race not inhabitants of the State, or to instruct or teach in any such school or institution, or board or harbor for that purpose, any such person without the previous consent in writing of the civil authority of the town in which such school or institution might be.

 Justice Taney mentions a provision in New Hampshire  in 1815, in which

>no one was permitted to be enrolled in the militia of the State but free white citizens, and the same provision is found in a subsequent collection of the laws made in 1855. Nothing could more strongly mark the entire repudiation of the African race. The alien is excluded because, being born in a foreign country, he cannot be a member of the community until he is naturalized. But why are the African race, born in the State, not permitted to share in one of the highest duties of the citizen? The answer is obvious; he is not, by the institutions and laws of the State, numbered among its people. He forms no part of the sovereignty of the State, and is not therefore called on to uphold and defend it.

 And finally he mentions an 1822 Rhode Island law

>forbidding persons who were authorized to join persons in marriage from joining in marriage any white person with any negro, Indian, or mulatto, under the penalty of two hundred dollars, and declaring all such marriages absolutely null and void, and the same law was again reenacted in its revised code of 1844. So that, down to the last-mentioned period, the strongest mark of inferiority and degradation was fastened upon the African race in that State.

 It is after his list of such restrictive and discriminatory laws that Justice Taney extrapolates that if it was the will of the states to exclude the black population from the status of citizenship within each of their respective dominions, then it is only appropriate that the same demographic be excluded from citizenship by the national government into which the respective states had vested their collective interests.  As Taney states,

>For if they were so received, and entitled to the privileges and immunities of citizens, it would exempt them from the operation of the special laws and from the police regulations which they considered to be necessary for their own safety.

 And then it is here where Taney states the excerpt which pro-gun advocates so often emphasize:

>It would give to persons of the negro race, who were recognised as citizens in any one State of the Union, the right to enter every other State whenever they pleased, singly or in companies, without pass or passport, and without obstruction, to sojourn there as long as they pleased, to go where they pleased at every hour of the day or night without molestation, unless they committed some violation of law for which a white man would be punished; and it would give them the full liberty of speech in public and in private upon all subjects upon which its own citizens might speak; to hold public meetings upon political affairs, *and to keep and carry arms wherever they went*.

Upon looking at the larger context of this excerpt, it would seem that the excerpt doesn’t actually mean what the pro-gun advocates interpret it to mean.  First of all, it would seem that some of the items within this excerpt correlate with the prohibitive laws previously mentioned.  The first is when he mentions “the right to enter every other State whenever they pleased . . . without pass or passport . . . .”  This correlates with the aforementioned 1774 Connecticut provision that required people of color to carry a pass when wandering outside the town of their residence.  And the second correlated item is -- in my interpretation -- the infamous line “and to keep and carry arms wherever they went”.   I understand this line to be an allusion to the 1815 New Hampshire law which limited the right of militia duty to only free white citizens of the state.   

Gun-rights advocates would likely interpret the latter line to refer to the text of the second amendment, and to refer to an individual right to own and carry guns for private purposes, such as self defense or sport.  However, it makes no sense for the line “to keep and carry arms wherever they went” to refer to the text of the second amendment.  Even though this line may sound similar to the line “the right of the people to keep and bear arms”, they are not the same, and the differences between the two are not at all negligible.  First of all, the second amendment refers to the right to “bear arms”, while the line from *Dred Scott* says “carry arms”.  The modern reader may simply see these two phrases as synonymous, but they are not.  The meaning of “carry arms” is straightforward, consisting of a transitive verb acting upon a noun; but the phrase “bear arms” does not actually refer to the carrying of arms, but rather is itself a phrasal verb and an idiomatic expression.  According to the Oxford English Dictionary -- the most authoritative resource on the English language -- the expression “bear arms” originated around AD 1325, and is correlated with the Latin phrase *arma ferre*, likely being simply a direct translation of the Latin.  Also according to the Oxford English Dictionary, the phrase is defined simply as “To serve as a soldier; to fight (for a country, cause, etc.).”  The sense of the phrase ""the right to bear arms"" in the sense that pro-gun advocates typically use the phrase is, according to the Oxford dictionary, an originally and chiefly American re-definition of the phrase, originating circa 1776.  Hence, the second amendment references the right of the people to keep arms and *to fight* and/or *serve as a soldier*; while the *Dred Scott* line instead references the right to keep arms and carry arms.  

Furthermore, the *Dred Scott* line also differs from the second amendment by including the modifier “wherever they went”.  No such modifier exists in the second amendment.  In fact, the second amendment is merely a prohibitive provision, one which is applied against Congress itself, and does not directly apply any affirmative granting of rights to the people.  It makes no sense to interpret an absolute prohibition against Congress as somehow establishing a modified affirming of rights to the people.  Because of these linguistic and textual details, it is, at best, quite a stretch to claim that the phrase “and to keep and carry arms wherever they went” is somehow a meaningful reference to the second amendment.

Some might alternatively argue that the line, rather than referring to the text of the second amendment specifically, is instead referring to the liberty of private gun use in general.  But what makes much more sense is that the line “and to keep and carry arms wherever they went”, instead of referring to private gun use, actually refers to militia duty.  It was customary in early America for militiamen to possess arms -- such as muskets or rifles -- in their personal custody (i.e. “to keep arms”), and to literally carry them wherever they went.  We can see evidence of this from numerous militia-related laws from early America from colonial times until the 20th century.  On example is a New York law from 1640:

>ORDINANCE

>Of the Director and Council of New Netherland, providing for the Arming and mustering of the Militia in case of danger. Passed 9 May, 1640.

>\[N.Y. Col. MSS. IV. 61.\]

>The Honble Director and Council have considered it advisable to ordain that the Inhabitants residing at and around Fort Amsterdam, of what state, quality or condition soever they be, *shall each provide himself with a good gun and keep the same in good repair and at all times ready and in order*; and as they live at a distance the one from the other, every warned person is placed under his Corporal in order that in time of danger he may appear at his post with his gun. Should it happen, which God forbid, that any mischief occur either from enemies or traitors at night, the people will be notified by the discharge of three cannon fired in quick succession; and if by day, means will be found to give warning to every one, who is commanded thereupon to repair instantly to his Corporal at the place appointed and then to adopt such measures as the exigency of the case shall require, on pain of being fined Fifty guilders. \[[link](https://firearmslaw.duke.edu/laws/1640-n-y-laws-23-ordinance-of-the-director-and-council-of-new-netherland-providing-for-the-arming-and-mustering-of-the-militia-in-case-of-danger)\]

So it would seem that with a deeper understanding of the workings of the militia during early American history, the modifier “wherever they went” should more sensibly be correlated with the common practices surrounding compulsory militia service, rather than being correlated with any sort of voluntary liberty of carrying arms for private purposes.  

The connection that the pro-gun community makes between *Dred Scott* and the second amendment is tenuous at best.  Within the passage in bold from *Dred Scott*, there are four stated civil rights: the right to travel freely without a pass, the right to freedom of speech, the right to hold public meetings on political issues, and the right to keep and carry arms.  Of these four rights, only one of them can be said to correlate directly to the Bill of Rights: the right of freedom of speech.  The rest have no connection to the Bill of Rights.  And to assume that the phrase “to keep and carry arms” is directly related to the second amendment is a stretch, since the language between the two statements has only a superficial correlation.  These stated civil rights in bold do not represent the contents of the Bill of Rights, and thus cannot be interpreted as a general reference to that document; and the phrase “to keep and carry arms wherever they went” does not represent the second amendment directly; for these reasons, there is simply no argument that this passage from *Dred Scott* supports second amendment rights.   

Of the four stated civil rights, it would appear that Justice Taney mentions two of them as allusions to previously mentioned statutes: the line “and to keep and carry arms wherever they went” correlates to the aforementioned 1815 New Hampshire militia law which excluded black people from militia service; and an even more obvious connection is made between the line “the right to enter every other State whenever they pleased . . . without pass or passport” and the 1774 Connecticut law requiring black people to carry a pass while traveling.  

The other two stated civil rights -- freedom of speech and the right to hold public meetings -- appear to be outliers of this pattern, as they appear to have been mentioned without any aforementioned precedent in state law.  However, there might still be a particular reason why Justice Taney saw fit to mention these particular rights.  It so happens that most of the items listed in the bolded excerpt are also stipulated in the Declaration of Rights in the 1820 Missouri State Constitution.  This is especially relevant since the *Dred Scott* case centered on whether the plaintiff was still considered a slave in the slave state of Missouri after having gained his freedom after traveling to the free state of Illinois.  Notably, the two outlier items are also addressed in the Missouri Constitution.

The statement from *Dred Scott* which says “and it would give them the full liberty of speech in public and in private upon all subjects upon which its own citizens might speak” appears to correlate with Article 13, Clause 16:

>That the free communication of thoughts and opinions is one of the invaluable rights of man, and that every person may freely speak, write, and print, on any subject, being responsible for the abuse of that liberty.

 And the statement “to hold public meetings upon political affairs” appears to correlate with Article 13, Clause 2:

>That the people of this state have the inherent, sole, and exclusive right of regulating the internal government and police thereof, and of altering and abolishing their constitution and form of government, whenever it may be necessary to their safety and happiness.

Furthermore, in addition to their connection to the discriminatory laws already established within the text of *Dred Scott*, the remaining two items from the excerpt also appear to have correlates in the Missouri Constitution as well.  The statement about the right of a citizen “to enter every other State whenever they pleased” appears to correlate with a clause in Article 3, section 26:

>It shall be their \[the general assembly’s\] duty, as soon as may be, to pass such laws as may be necessary--1. To prevent free negroes and mulattoes from coming to and settling in this State, under any pretext whatsoever;

 And it also seems to correlate with Article 13, Clause 21:

> That migration from this state cannot be prohibited.

And the statement “and to keep and carry arms wherever they went” appears to correlate with the state arms provision in part of Article 13, Clause 3:

>that their right to bear arms, in defense of themselves and of the state, cannot be questioned.

Compared to the second amendment, this arms provision in the Missouri Constitution seems more pertinent to the arms statement mentioned in the *Dred Scott* decision, since this provision specifically qualifies the lawful purposes for which the right to bear arms may be exercised, which the second amendment does not do.

**Conclusion**

Some might say that it only makes sense that Justice Taney is referring to the federal Bill of Rights in the bolded excerpt because he is speaking on behalf of the United States Supreme Court, which is a federal body.  However, this interpretation is uninformed.  When we look at the actual context of the *Dred Scott* decision, it is clear that the particular point that Justice Taney is making in that excerpt pertains much more to state law than to federal law.  Even though the decision that Justice Taney is making is a federal decision, he is clearly making this federal decision based on state premises.

It has never been the primary prerogative of the federal government to grant rights to American citizens.  It is state governments that have the primary authority and function of specifying and granting civil rights.  Hence, Justice Taney wasn't saying that making black people into citizens -- at the federal level -- would give them rights; his point was that federally making black people into citizens would effectively negate the prohibitive laws that the states have established in order to subjugate their black populations.  In other words, making black people into citizens would create a kind of ""double negative"" whose effect is a positive: it would not actually give them anything, but instead would *take away* the laws that *take away* their liberties.  The verbiage ""it would *give* to persons of the negro race..."" is hence metaphorical rather than literal.  It's like if a judge were to exonerate a convicted prison inmate through DNA evidence: the judge isn't actually *giving* the inmate his freedom; the judge is just *removing* his incarceration.  Thus, it is merely the result of a quirk of language and rhetoric that Justice Taney *appears* to be affirming that American citizens are entitled to the liberty to keep and carry arms wherever they go.  But for gun advocates to take this rhetoric literally, as they often do, is simply a wrong conclusion to draw

As for the content of the bolded excerpt, I can’t say how purposeful or how arbitrary this particular assortment of rights was meant to be.  At least two of the four items appear to be references to state laws which he had previously referenced, yet he breaks this pattern with the other two items, which do not have any statutory precursor in *Dred Scott*; and there are even more state laws referenced earlier that he *does not* allude to in the bolded list.  And furthermore, all of the items in the list could be said to have correlates in the 1820 Missouri Constitution; but it is not clear whether Justice Taney was actually alluding to that constitution in particular -- because of its relevance to the case at hand, or if he was referencing any other state constitution.  In summary, I don’t know exactly why Justice Taney chose the particular list of items that he chose in the bolded excerpt of his majority opinion in *Dred Scott*; however, I can say with much more confidence what this excerpt *does not* indicate.  He is not referencing the federal Bill of Rights as a whole; he is not referencing the second amendment in particular; and he is likely not referencing the general liberty of private firearm rights.  Therefore, there is no basis for pro-gun advocates to use this case as a means to argue for firearm rights.

Conservatives think that it is dangerous to keep people in the country without knowing they're here, having people come into the country legally makes sure that we have made sure they are law-abiding people that understand and respect our ways.

It isn't that we are opposed to immigrants or immigration. The issue is that the mathematics of bringing in millions of people into the country compared to the housing crisis and cost of living crisis is just too unrealistic.

We only want to pause immigration until we have resources and jobs for migrants. The hate is only starting because nobody has been turning off the tap on the issue and the previous ""crises'"" are getting more extreme as well.

\- Possibly doomed Ukraine to become a Russian vassal state. You probably don't care, because you do not possess the acumen to understand how this undermines Europe, which used to be your main allies, friends and trade partners.

democrats,hot,'You can stop donating now': Newsom doesn't want any more of your money,,154,149,5,"Snippet:

* Few things are more guaranteed in life than death, taxes and politicians asking for more donations. But in California’s fight over Proposition 50, Gov. Gavin Newsom has pulled an unprecedented move: He’s asking people to stop giving money.
* “You can stop donating now,” Newsom wrote in an email to supporters Monday. He further explained in a video posted to X on Tuesday that his campaign has hit its fundraising goals after receiving $38 million from 1.2 million donors. “Enough,” Newsom said in the video, **“Thank you, I never thought I’d ever say that. We’ve raised enough money to win this campaign.”**
* The governor is projecting supreme confidence with just a week before voters decide on Proposition 50, which would redraw California’s congressional districts along partisan lines in an attempt to elect more Democrats. Newsom has championed the gerrymandering measure after states like Texas have redrawn their maps to benefit Republicans. 
* **Public opinion polling has found that a majority of voters support the redistricting initiative, and Newsom’s campaign has built a big advantage in fundraising. The Democratic side has raised nearly $100 million since the campaign started in July, but Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the former majority leader and Bakersfield Republican, has raised only $11 million of his goal to bring in $100 million to fight Newsom’s proposal.** The majority of opposition funding has come from Charles Munger Jr., a Palo Alto scientist and son of billionaire Charles Munger. The younger Munger has given $30 million to fight Prop. 50. ",24,2025-10-29 13:22:21,2025-10-29 13:23:43,0

She was appointed to the position in an interim capacity in March, until the senate confirmed a nominee. Trump nominated her, but in July she had not been confirmed by the Senate, and her legally allowed capacity was about to end. A panel judges chose someone else to fill the position until a nominee was confirmed. Trump withdrew her nomination which would allow her to serve in an acting capacity, and then Pam Bondi fired the prosecutor that the panel of judges had appointed. Which allowed Habba to be named the acting prosecutor despite the fact that the senate had not confirmed her and the panel of judges chose someone else to fill the position instead of her.

A judge ruled this was invalid, but stayed his own order pending appeal. So she's still serving in a capacity that was was ruled to be invalid.

There are a few representatives that don't know how evil/corrupt Trump and his network actually are. Almost all of the republicans know. They are just such lowlifes that they are more worried about losing their jobs than doing the right thing.

democrats,hot,Wu announces universal before- and after-school care plan in first State of the Schools speech,,49,47,2,"SAVING THE COUNTRY FROM TRUMP

Everyone has to help get the word of mouth out to the people who don’t have social media.

If you want to get rid of Trump then we have to get the Democrats the majority. The DOJ has sealed files implicating Trump in multiple rape cases against children. Those files are the key to having Trump impeached.

The Democrats want those sealed files released. Make sure you vote for Democrat representatives in 2026. OTHERWISE TRUMP AND HIS CORRUPT NETWORK WILL CONTINUE THEIR DESTRUCTION OF AMERICA

FOR NOW ——-///-

Everyone has to educate their House and Senate representatives about Trump raping women and children. Everyone has to educate them that Trump is doing everything in his power to cover that up. Almost everyone in Trump’s network has previously helped him cover up his crimes against women and children. Call, write letters and emails to your representatives.

There are a few representatives that don't know how evil/corrupt Trump and his network actually are. Almost all of the republicans know. They are just such lowlifes that they are more worried about losing their jobs than doing the right thing.

THE EPSTEIN/TRUMP FILES HAVE TO BE RELEASED. That’s how we get Trump impeached.

H.R. 4405, the Epstein Files Transparency Act has to pass for that to happen.

Don’t let the Republican representatives convince you they voted for this. THAT’S A LIE. They voted for H.R. 668 intended to clear Trump’s name from the sealed files.

Republicans are nothing more than paid voters

Everyone has to help get the word of mouth out to the people who don’t have social media.

If you want to get rid of Trump then we have to get the Democrats the majority. The DOJ has sealed files implicating Trump in multiple rape cases against children. Those files are the key to having Trump impeached.

The Democrats want those sealed files released. Make sure you vote for Democrat representatives in 2026. OTHERWISE TRUMP AND HIS CORRUPT NETWORK WILL CONTINUE THEIR DESTRUCTION OF AMERICA

FOR NOW ——-///-

Everyone has to educate their House and Senate representatives about Trump raping women and children. Everyone has to educate them that Trump is doing everything in his power to cover that up. Almost everyone in Trump’s network has previously helped him cover up his crimes against women and children. Call, write letters and emails to your representatives.

There are a few representatives that don't know how evil/corrupt Trump and his network actually are. Almost all of the republicans know. They are just such lowlifes that they are more worried about losing their jobs than doing the right thing.

THE EPSTEIN/TRUMP FILES HAVE TO BE RELEASED. That’s how we get Trump impeached.

H.R. 4405, the Epstein Files Transparency Act has to pass for that to happen.

Don’t let the Republican representatives convince you they voted for this. THAT’S A LIE. They voted for H.R. 668 intended to clear Trump’s name from the sealed files.

Republicans are nothing more than paid voters

Defending Democracy

Kross and Mills (2025) warn that societies fall when they “feel helpless against this action.” When journalists adopt a tone of inevitability about executive power, they mirror the very dynamic of passivity that hybrid adversaries seek to induce. Reporting that foregrounds contest, checks, and ongoing review counters that drift. Journalist Rachel Maddow (2024) articulates the same principle in civic terms: “when it comes to your rights, use them or lose them.” She argues that protest not only asserts freedom but keeps people sane because it exercises agency that authoritarians seek to extinguish. Even when leaders appear unmoved, visible dissent undermines the illusion of omnipotence. So too with reporting - each fact, each act of precise description, each acknowledgment of constitutional friction, becomes a protest against inevitability. Rhetoric, like citizenship, is a habit that must be carefully practiced to remain free.",3,2025-10-28 19:11:37,2025-10-28 19:11:52,0.6

democrats,hot,North Carolina Data Analysis Report - Election Truth Alliance,,45,42,3,"They use a lot of words, but they are not really describing their methods in way that is robust and reproducible.  If they want to be taken seriously, they need to reveal what they used (app / language, libraries, packages, etc. specific statistical methods, and so on), and justify why they made those choices.  They need to describe how they wrangled and cleaned the raw data.  And so on.

For example--their methodoly page gives summary descriptions, but does not show detailed data cleaning rules, variable definition (that is, how missing precents are handeled, for example), and the absence of code / open data means that we simply have to take their word for it.

It's just that they claim manipulation, so you expect deeper modeling.  Once again, they do not mention it, but one would assume they would utilize regression residuals, spatial clustering, time-series of precent behavior, anamoly detection, etc.  I mean, high-turnout precincts could corrospond to highly mobilized areas of one party, noew polling places, changed voter registration drives, etc.  None of these imply manipulation.  If these co-founders are not controlled, the inference is weak.

Once again, they could be on the money here.  Of course that implies that they could not be.  It's just athe ETA presents itself as an election integrity organization who's mission is to call for audits.  While their analysis seems better than most, it is stilll not strong enough for forensics or to show manipulation.

Their mission is to ""expose the truth"", which is language that suggests strong advocacy and possible bias.  The thing with statistics, statistical testing, analysis, etc. is that you have to accept that the results may not align with your own views.  Admitting that your thesis did not pan out as expected is NOT weakness, it lends credibility to your efforts so that when you do find the smoking gun, it will hold up.

The irony is that if ETA can, in the end, show that 2024 was not manipulated, this would lend credibility to 2020 not being stolen, and that, if 2026 or 2028 are truly anomalous, it would be easier to sell to auditors.

Edit to add:  I am not picking on ETA.  It's just that public distrust in 'science' is already pretty low, so the need to be as transparent as possible is greater now than ever.  But on the other hand, what I wrote is also true of other organizations, inlcuing those who are MAGA / HF aligned.",5,2025-10-27 13:04:14,2025-10-27 15:49:09,0.6

“In 2025/2026, our new ads will continue to star “Your Republican Congressman” as he invades the everyday lives of real Americans. The 30-second ads will be seen on streaming services and social media to educate voters, infiltrate the GOP media ecosystem, stop Trump’s agenda, and win back Congress. Content will focus on the issues that concern Americans, especially young men who swung towards Trump by 30 points last cycle. We have already started targeting these young men with our latest viral ad, “Republicans Blowing Your Taxes,” which was viewed over 10 million times and broke through the noise by being featured outlets like TMZ.”

A debate with JD would draw a lot of eyes but also I think Gavin is setting up a run for president. A debate with the vice president would really legitimize his chances to possible voters/viewers and put him ahead in primarys. I don't think JD will do it tho, but not because they are in some way scared but because it would give attention to Gavin more so.

Dear Governor,


I urge you to consider the formation of a coalition of Democratic Governors to counter the growing threat of federal overreach. Elon Musk now controls the Treasury payment system, giving him dangerous influence over federal funding that millions rely on. If we do nothing, critical programs could be sabotaged at his whim.


We need a unified Blue-State Emergency Coalition to: 

✅ Coordinate legal challenges to block unconstitutional federal actions. 

✅ Declare a collective State of Emergency to protect state resources. 

✅ Refuse cooperation with unlawful federal directives.


This is not about partisanship—it’s about defending democracy and economic stability. We must act before it’s too late. You have the leadership and influence to make this happen. Will you take action?


I look forward to your response.

I was never a huge trump supporter even living in a red bubble, but I did vote for him in 2016 because I thought clinton was evil(was still religious then too).
In 2020 after seeing how he behaved up to that point I decided I cant vote for him again so I went libertarian. And now after seeing J6 go down, even though I probably still agree with libertarianism more, I have to use my vote wisely and put as much force against trump as possible so I decided to vote democrat. My friends and relatives have pretty much all abandoned me and ignore me now as they are all huge religious maga people.
My vote will be far outweighed by republican voters here in my county, I wish I could have voted in a swing county here in Tx to try and push the state blue, but it is what it is, I have done what I can legally do.
I hope one day more people around me will see the light.
You are not alone, welcome aboard the anti-trump train.",184,2024-11-02 12:06:25,2024-11-02 12:37:41,0.9
