From the source you posted:

> In 2025, more than 3 million seniors are going to save thousands of dollars because of a new spending limit on prescription drugs. **It's unclear whether the Trump Administration will keep the law.**

&nbsp;

This article is from yesterday, and it is already outdated. Trump just EO'd the reversal of the law.

&nbsp;

> Prescription drug expenses are going way down for about 3 million American seniors this year. That's because **the Biden administration capped out-of-pocket prescription costs** - not for everybody, just those on Medicare with some of the highest costs. It's part of **the Inflation Reduction Act**.

&nbsp; 

>> The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) is a United States federal law which aims to reduce the federal government budget deficit, lower prescription drug prices, and invest in domestic energy production while promoting clean energy. **It was passed by the 117th United States Congress and signed into law by President Joe Biden on August 16, 2022.**

Trump just reversed Biden's Executive Order 14087, the EO that lowered prescription drug costs for Americans.

conservatives,controversial,"Jimmy Carter Was a Terrible President, and an Even Worse Former President ",,109,71,38,"I had to use a summarizing reader to bypass the paywall.

I disagree with the article as well, though they do cite situations where Carter undermined even the Clinton administration, none of the information has true veracity. ""A cabinet member"" called him a ""treasonous prick"" but no one was willing to go on record.

Personally it's just my opinion that Carter was spineless against our adversaries, and would have undermined US strength overseas with limp foreign policy. Dictators and despots responded to his pacifism by exploiting his willingness to give up US interests in the name of global harmony. He was a foreign policy disaster.

All that said, he was a wonderful human who naively saw the best in people, including tyrants, to his own detriment. His work on charitable causes did the world overall a lot of good and helped US interests with its allies.

His weakness was also part of his extraordinary kindness, and while he was a terrible president, it's unfair to say he was a terrible ex-President. Clinton should have shown a backbone and retaken control of the North Korea negotiations, making public statements and stepping in to reign in Carter. I understand he was worried about oppositional political party actions taken against him for not showing solidarity, but again, we're suppose to be a united country.

Tesla’s stock price has fallen sharply—almost 50 percent since its mid-December, postelection peak—on the back of terrible sales numbers in Europe.

It’s normal and good for presidents to seek guidance from advisors who are experienced and successful. Musk is definitely an out-there personality sometimes, but he didn’t become the richest man in the world by accident. He’s clearly got some experience at optimizing operations. His “downturn” right now is not really that notable. The bigger you are the more room you have to fall. I can’t lose 145 billion or whatever, bc I dont have anything close to that. Musk not only can “lose” that, but he is still a billionaire and massively successful without it. It’s just a reflection of market forces. It will even out over time. It’s hyperbole to say he is struggling. 

Everyone just needs to calm the F down. President seeks successful advisors-normal and good. Markets go up and down and people with lots of stock have their net worth fluctuate with the markets - normal. Nothing really to see here. 

Trump buying a Tesla is a bit showy, but also nothing out of the ordinary. Presidents make public shows of support for American products and companies all the time.

The Atlantic is considered one of the most liberal and slanted “news“ sources.  Even the words you quoted here are such hyperbolic opinion with no substance to them. Read multiple sources for the news you get double check what you’re reading from other places if you’re legitimately here to get information and to learn and to engage, great (I mentioned that because the majority of those “I’m confused I thought things were good, but now I found out that This Republican is actually Satan“ posts are disingenuous at best. 

Also, look at the trajectory of the media coverage of Elon Musk. Musk was hailed as the answer to global warming. Musk is provided aid through Skylink and other things to countries around the world in time of crisis, including our own he then made one massive mistake in the eyes of the left. He wanted free speech so he bought Twitter so that people could exchange opinions and discuss issues rather than being shut down before being able to do so. If you go back and look at the news coverage of that time, you will see that the news coverage immediately started calling him a Nazi, unhinged, etc. They pushed him from being a Democratic leaning non-political entrepreneur into politics. The veil was removed from his eyes if you will, and he saw the things were not neutral. There was a cadre of people who seek to limit free speech and use the tools of the power of government and media to silence critics and so he volunteered to help route out waste and mismanagement. He was hired by Trump to be an aid, working for no money as does Trump and that has sparked terrorist attacks on his businesses and media attacks on others. (to give even greater contacts look at Joe Rogan a lifelong Democrat because he allowed Trump on his show, was castigated by the left, Tulsi Gabbard, a Democratic presidential candidate disagreed with Democratic policies and was therefore put on a no fly list by the Biden administration and called a nut and a threat to national security. RFK Junior and admittedly odd fellow, but a lifelong Democrat and the proposed running mate for Bernie Sanders disagreed with the Democrats on a couple issues and so then he is a nut job. Who’s a danger to America even Donald Trump lifelong Democrat criticize the Democratic Party uncertain things and he’s a Nazi.

PoliticalDiscussion,hot,What would a potential framework of a shutdown-ending ACA deal look like?,"Right now, Republicans have said they don’t want to start ACA negotiations until Democrats agree to reopen the government. Democrats have said they don’t want to reopen government until there’s a deal on what to do with the ACA. Eventually, one side will cave on the timing (which is not what this topic is about) but rather what the substance of that agreement might look like.

The cost of fully extending the enhanced ACA tax credits (originally passed during the 117th Congress) is roughly $300 to $400 billion over the next decade, per the CBO. Republicans have said they want to try to find pay-fors and ways to reduce the cost. Proposals they’ve floated (as outlined by POLITICO) include income limits, work requirements, abortion restrictions, SSN verification and other measures that are unlikely to be popular with Democrats. They’ve also floated a 1-year extension and closing off the tax credits to new applicants, who technically wouldn’t face sharp spikes in insurance premiums if they were never enrolled in Obamacare to begin with.

4. Cuomo's attempt to position himself as the moderate alternative hasnt gained the traction many expected, despite his name recognition and Adams endorsement.

There are local aspects but also national aspects. When a party goes down in defeat in a general election, there tends to be a whipsaw effect where ""anti-establishment"" candidates in the defeated party have a better chance because people are upset with their own party for blowing it and making them look like fools. This analogy will be a bit of a stretch but it's kind of like what happens when a country loses a war. Elections like wars are contests of political systems, so the reform process that occurs in the aftermath of defeats are a more or less natural process that happens like evolution. Like or dislike Mamdani, it makes no difference, if the Democratic Party is in need of reform, it will find someone. The old guard will try to resist but it will only lead to more defeats, and the reform cannot be put off forever otherwise they will go extinct, and parties don't willingly let that happen to themselves.

There are also local aspects, but I'm not from New York. But from a distance what's very obvious is how Mamdani consolidated the progressive vote while the anti-Mamdani vote has been divided.

PoliticalDiscussion,hot,How does Mamdani's lead in NYC mayoral race reflect broader shifts in Democratic urban politics?,"With early voting already underway and Mamdani maintaining a double digit lead in most polls, it seems increasingly likely that NYC will elect its first democratic socialist mayor. Im curious what this signals about the state of urban Democratic politics more broadly.

Some observations that Im trying to make sense of:

1. Mamdani won the primary decisively despite Cuomo having massive financial advantages and institutional support. The DSA ground game and social media operation seemed to overcome traditional power structures in a way we havent seen before at this scale, causing polymarket chance to skyrocket.
2. His platform (rent freezes, free buses, universal childcare) is significantly to the left of what we typically see winning in major cities. Even de Blasio who was considered progressive didnt run on this kind of agenda.
3. The Wall Street and real estate reaction has been notable. There were reports of emergency meetings after the primary and significant money flowing to Cuomo's independent campaign, but Mamdani has stayed pretty consistently ahead even as Cuomo's tried to close the gap.
4. Cuomo's attempt to position himself as the moderate alternative hasnt gained the traction many expected, despite his name recognition and Adams endorsement.

My questions: Does Mamdanis success represent a genuine realignment in urban Democratic politics or is this more specific to NYCs unique circumstances (Adams corruption scandal, affordability crisis, etc)? If he wins and governs successfully, does this provide a template for progressive candidates in other major cities? And conversely, if his policies struggle or he loses, what does that tell us about the limits of left populism in urban governance?

Im particularly interested in perspectives on how replicable this model is. NYC has unique advantages for this kind of politics (strong tenant organizing, large public sector unions, diverse working class base) that might not exist elsewhere.",271,254,17,"I think Mamdani shows that Democrats want someone who is not overly cautious or generic. For example, Mikie Sherill is the perfect safe candidate. Sherrill is a military vet, been a team player in the House for 6yrs, moderate on policy, white, heterosexual, not super old, etc. Voters seem willing to tolerate Sherrill (maybe) but not excited.

Safe moderate officisls that espouse calm and measured governance have failed to protect the public from Trump. Boyscouts like Garland did nothing. Schumer's strongly worded letters do nothing. Whitmer hid behind a binder ffs. I agree on policy with Jefferies, Schumer, Whitmer, etc yet can hardly tolerate hearing their voices anymore. Because they are so weak. They labor over press releases while Trump tears down part of the White House and blows up fishing boats in the Caribbean. 

Mamdani gets attention and speaks in real time. One doesn't have to wait a couple days while Mamdani drafts a press release with feather and ink over candle light.",74,2025-10-28 00:36:30,2025-10-28 12:51:00,0.60

It seems like part of is the other candidates were weak. In addition, the top contenders were Cuomo, who is very unpopular, and Adams, who was even more unpopular and later dropped out. That's not to imply Mamdani isn't popular, as he obviously is, but he was certainly helped by weak competition. I don't agree with Mamdani, yet I would have voted for him over the corrupt Cuomo. And that wouldn't indicate I shifted my beliefs. I'm just refusing to re-elect a proven corrupt politician.

But I also think there was some Trump strategy with Mamdani in that he was telling voters exactly what they wanted to hear. Trump told voters in Pittsburgh he was bringing steel back. He told voters in WV he was bringing coal back. He told voters in rust belt towns he would keep their factories open and in the US. It was all bullshit, but it was exactly what those voters wanted to hear.

PoliticalDiscussion,hot,What are your thoughts on unified power?,"
It's an old idea tied to some of the Marxist schools of thought, although in fact some of the theory predates his birth by a century to Rousseau. It dissents from the way Americans would think of separation of powers, as well as the way constitutional monarchies would have viewed such a concept as well (back when kings had stronger autonomous power, in some cases the prime minister didn't even need express confidence of parliament). It isn't technically an economic system, it could be used without a socialistic system or anything built on a socialist platform, but the Marxist forms of communism was one of the main advocates. 

To me, given what we know about how stable and peaceful societies can work, it's actually rather a dull idea to me. It concentrates a lot of power in something called a supreme state organ of power, which I will just call the assembly or parliament to keep it relatable. It can establish, disestablish, and reformat other departments as it wishes, and is the principal source of legitimacy through which popular decisions (people, not degree of public approval) are made. 

We know that strong democracies which are places that most people would be quite happy to live in such as Finland or New Zealand do not have the power of courts to strike laws down by conflict with the constitution. We know that in places like Finland or Austria, Parliament itself can amend the constitution itself (in the case of Austria, it's basically a 2/3 vote, although sometimes the mostly ceremonial upper house has to approve of changes too). Some high courts of some countries like the Netherlands have the legislature be the source of who appoints their members (the House of Representatives in the Dutch case, although they de facto take a list of candidates from a technical judicial council to choose from), or how in Switzerland, the supreme court judges (without the power to void federal laws) are elected for 6 year renewable terms by a joint session of parliament by secret ballot, and Swiss people evidently rejected a proposal in a referendum to choose the judges in a different way not too long ago. Plus, some countries particularly stringently control the use of executive directives and ministerial orders like Sweden via the approval of the assembly. 

And in a parliamentary system, by definition the executive has the confidence of the legislature but some go even further and solely empower the legislature to choose the prime minister without any head of state involvement and the selection and dismissal of ministers is done solely by the legislature (as in Bavaria). Places like Britain and Canada make the independent officers like the auditor general and the director of public prosecutions dependent on Parliament, for the existence of their office which was created by statute and to be appointed or dismissed from office ahead of their term of office expiring. Unified power does allow the legislature to prescribe how exactly something will be done and is perfectly fine with dividing a function up to prevent things like corruption, such as demanding one person have the key to something, one person authorizes the use of the key, another person possesses the lock, and another person records the use of the key. 

Recalling parliament is a relatively rare power which the doctrine of unified power advocates for but about half the German states do permit this, as does Lithuania, where a petition signed by enough people triggers a question to the people of whether to hold a new election, and if it passes, then a new election is so held.

When put like that, it's actually kinda boring to read much of the literature on Unified Power vs Separation of Powers. The reasons underpinning why most people would not call a place like China or the USSR a democracy has little to do with the theoretical power of the legislature to do just about anything, and at least in the places where they are strongly democratic like New Zealand for instance, at least on the plus side how they in practice act like they are going by unified power then when a reform is passed by parliament with the public having persuaded people to agree with it, it will not be blocked by an outside power the way many Americans hate the times when the supreme court blocked political financing legislation.

What do you think?",0,0,0,"In Finland courts can refuse to apply laws based on conflict with Constitution.

In New Zealand courts can issue declarations of inconsistency with their Bill of Rights and fundamentally reinterpret the statutes to be consistent.   Parliament is obligated to respond to and deal with the declaration of inconsistency.

In both cases, there is a  parliamentary review AT THE TIME THE LAW IS PASSED to ensure the law is consistent with their constitution/bill of rights.

Both of these systems have sovereign parliaments - they are not presidential systems and we are not talking about their equivalent of ""executive orders"" because they dont have them.  Prime ministers are not presidents.   There is a very clear separation of powers.  These are not ""unified power"" systems and certainly not what the US is now toying with, a ""unitary executive"" power.

In fact the very concept of separation of powers was first coined and expressed in the context of parliamentary democracy (Locke/Montesquieu, both describing British parliamentary democracy).

So I think you are making a basic classification error by describing parliamentary sovereignty as ""unified power"".  These are distinct concepts and parliamentary sovereignty is very much compatible with strict separation of pwers.",14,2025-10-28 11:54:59,2025-10-28 12:08:08,0

What do you think?",0,0,0,"And to add, the US *does* have an independent “parliament”- we just call it Congress. The big distinction is that the President is not a *creature of parliament*.

In the UK, for example, the PM is subject to the whims of the majority coalition (much like our Speaker of the House is). The PM, though it’s the closest analog to the President, has very little if any authority to *oppose* parliament at-large. In contrast, the Framers extricated the executive function of government from the legislative to create a check on legislative power. It’s quaint for us today seeing as Congress is MIA, but the Framers were fearful of a vacuous Congress that subsumed all powers into itself.

Call me Constitution-pilled, but there really is a secret sauce with the way the US system was set up. Splitting power between the States and Federal government, and further dividing the State and Federal powers into three equal parts, gives us an absurdly robust defense against government overreach as citizens. It’s a system that typically moves slowly, and only by broad consensus when it does.

Trump, obviously, is the elephant in the room. His administration is throwing its full weight into the guardrails of government in an attempt to accumulate more power. But I think Trump is a perfect example of just how goddamned robust the Constitution and dual-federalism are. Try as he may with a supine Congress and a friendly SCOTUS, he’s *still* encountering resistance at nearly every step. 

I also think that his governing coalition is in for a **very** rude awakening once Democrat-run states rediscover what their Republican-run counterparts have known since Jim Crow: You can basically tell the feds to go fuck themselves on most issues. Between interstate compacts and State sovereignty, blue states can largely take their ball and go home. Even more, *they can start playing their own game and not invite the feds or fed-aligned states to join in.* The Fugitive Slave Act and the non-compliance of Northern states is a shining example.

I’m looking for evidence-based perspectives on the *institutional mechanisms* that may evolve during extended shutdowns not partisan blame or speculation.",120,111,9,"The filibuster is pretty unique, so, there isn't really going to be good *actual evidence* in the sense of looking at other countries with a similar legislative setup and seeing what happened there.

That said, a few speculative thoughts.  Government shutdowns have happened before, so they are not totally unprecedented.  Moreover, they are gradually becoming less painful as agencies have figured out how to function or not function with them, money is being moved around, etc.  So, my best guess is that the default favors keeping the filibuster.  I think that if the GOP breaks it here, for a normal spending bill, it's gone forever, and I think the Republicans are still better off with the filibuster than without it.  Were this the opposite situation --- a Dem President and Congress and recalcitrant minority Senate GOP, I think it may be broken there.

As for oversight, in some sense, with the government shut down, what is there to oversee?  A bit joking, but, with vast swaths of federal employees at home, regular oversight is going to be frozen along with everything else.  Similarly although Congressional staff may be furloughed or excepted, Members of Congress themselves can certainly keep holding hearings (although maybe you mean, that agency directors and the like can't be called to testify.  This is actually perhaps unclear, if a director is an excepted person, could they testify?  Also military members are not furloughed so potentially military testimony could still proceed).

As for shutdowns themselves, ironically by making shutdowns less painful, they are more likely to happen, but also making the stakes less high.  It probably won't happen, but, there could be a world where enough laws are passed that most federal workers and the military keep getting paid, and the only thing that immediately stops are discretionary outside spending---think contracts with services or defense contractors that are not already paid out, and in that case, Congressional deadlock could last for a long time.",3,2025-10-27 00:41:20,2025-10-28 01:50:17,0

Regarding the government institutional mechanisms, one could argue that the reason that we have the shutdown in the first place is because the checks and balances are already not functioning.

For context she is not just EU ""critical"" she is full on sceptical and celebrated Brexit when it happened there is video evidence for this from the Vincent Brown political talk show on the night it happened. 

She is anti-western and will lend her support either overtly or tacitly to any anti-western group e.g Assad, Hezbollah Hamas and yes Russia. She has said Ukraine must stop fighting for its freedom and criticised those countries supporting its freedom struggle far more vitriolically and frequently than Russia. Indeed on the day of the invasion in February 2022, she attended an anti-NATO protest. 

She has also justified Russia's use of chemical weapons to murder innocent civilians by Russia in Salisbury where she said the assassination attempt of the Skripals and death of innocent bystanders should be seen and judged within the context of Nato aggression. 

She has criticised every member of the UN Security Council except Russia and China.

There are endless examples like this she is the definition of a campist and a tankie. The only saving grace is that she has no executive power.

It should be noted that the Irish left broadly support the above they can now generally be seen as anti-EU and either overtly pro-Russian or tacitly so.

I think that we need someone unafraid of standing loudly and proudly behind progressive principles, and busting corporate trusts with ruthless expedience, addressing healthcare and housing costs, and prosecuting key MAGA figures where possible, and aggressively crack down on voter suppression with the explicit goal of dealing a death blow to the domestic and global fascist movement. Anything less is to invite a return of this torrid bullshit and, put simply, the stakes are far too high. I think conservatives are bloodthirsty bigots, and addressing global climate change cannot be done as long as fossil fuel interests have insiders in government.

The aristocracy, empowered and emboldened by our overwhelming belief in capitalism, are *the* guilty parties without whom our contemporary nightmare scenario could not have taken place. There is no universe where we elect yet another candidate who coddles the rich and expect them not to be funding and building the next generation of maga fascism, just as they did this time. If we are to stop fascism in its tracks, it will require aggressive action against the wealthy. Ending Citizen's United, busting up the tech oligarchs, government support for open source software and transparent social media companies and algorithms, etc.

I don't trust most Democrats to do that, and I certainly don't trust Newsom to. But, push comes to shove, literally any Democrat would be preferable to any Republican - but not just any Democrat can create a durable, unified coalition that can endure through election cycles.

Conservatism is an existential threat to all people, everywhere. Between the bigotry central to the ideology to their rejection of the overwhelming empirical evidence for the reality of global climate change, human beings are under direct threat by the principles of this inhuman, anti-intellectual ideology. Conservatism has never wrought benefit to humanity, and it's long since past time it belongs in the history books alongside its brother ideologies of fascism, and chattel slavery. At stake is an egalitarian, sustainable world with human rights and liberty for all - conservatives have made it plainly evident that they do not support this for humans who are Muslim, Hispanic, LGBT, indigenous, South Korean apparently, etc. That is not an ideology that can be tamed or negotiated with, it just must be defeated in the name of civilized humanity.",2,2025-10-26 15:51:36,2025-10-28 09:59:21,1.0

Immigration is in fact displacing skilled workers in white collar jobs mostly for now in programming and software engineering, and is help to drive wages lower. Immigrant workers driver down wages in construction and agriculture, too.

Your renter analogy fails to view the renter as an investor, in the same way that rate hikes for electricity fail to include ratepayers as forced investors in energy companies to cover infrastructure upgrades.

But the problem isn't the immigrants, it's the policies that allow companies to exploit them,. Without a clear path to legal immigration, and with a business culture lacking in ethics and morality, demonizing immigrants as the source of the problem is easy. In reality it is the business community that willingly accepts and recruits undocumented workers because they know they can exploit them, and by doing so they can also exploit legal workers by comparing what they pay the undocumented worker to what it costs to pay a legal worker, and forcing the legal worker to accept less or lose the job to an undocumented worker. It doesn't matter what labor sector you look at, the games the same everywhere. The same businesspeople support divisive politics on immigration to deflect attention to their own criminality.

Ice goes after workers, but who goes after the businesses that draw them here and employs them?

No one.

When the regime seeks negative outcomes, that could be taken as an assertion that outcomes do not matter. 


The regime is 100% nihilistic. It believes that people's lives, the rule of law, the constitution, morality, and truth do not matter.

In his first term, I think part of the ""peace deal"" was that he would surround himself with reliable GOPers as a sort of compromise. (There is absolutely no way that Pence would have been in his top picks if it was only up to Trump.) So there was a lot of resistance coming from inside the government at the time, both from Democrats and from anti-Trump Republicans. 

In 2024, he loaded up with people he wanted, so this has been easier for him. In his first term, it felt like there was always somebody leaking something from inside the White House - everything Trump did was in the news before he even got pen to paper. Now that seems much more rare, and when something is leaked, it's usually much closer to actually happening - which doesn't indicate a higher level of access.

New forms of communication (social media, smart phones, podcasts, algorithms) allow for targeted disinformation and propaganda, funded by the super rich, conservative groups, religious groups, and Russian and Chinese groups.

Third Way neoliberalism inherently cannot ""lift all boats"", capitalism itself needs a constant influx of immigrants to jack up production/consumption and so avoid collapse of the debt ponzi, and liberals in general struggle to pass meaningful pro-social legislation, because they're either filibustered or sabotaged by the rich, require supermajorities that the public don't give them (almost a century since the last meaningful one), or because it's almost impossible to concoct a policy that triangulates between capital, labour, and the civil sector; the economic system's contradictions and antagonisms run too deep.

5. With liberals unable to substantially address core issues, and with capitalism doing what it always does (most growth flows toward those with a monoply on land and credit, and rates of return on capital historically outpace growth; ie, no ""trickle down"") people become distrustful of the establishment; far right charlatans, backed by powerful coalitions, then sweep in. The masses are generally too uneducated to know where this leads.",60,2025-10-23 18:02:24,2025-10-24 10:33:22,0.9

Our lovely former Prime Minister Monsieur Trudeau allowed an uncapped amount of immigrants to enter the country, which became a major factor affecting the housing market and job opportunities. On the surface people tend to blame immigrants because that is what it looks like.

But if you dig a little deeper you realize it is not the immigrants’ fault. The real issue is how the whole system was managed. Many large companies lobby for more immigration because it means cheaper labor. It is a sad reality because big corporations benefit while Canadians end up with fewer or lower paying jobs, and immigrants who spent their life savings to come here often end up with nothing and eventually leave the country.

It becomes a constant loop. People shift toward right wing politics thinking that fewer immigrants will fix the issue, but that never solves anything. The real change comes from fixing the roots of the problem, not the surface.",24,2025-10-23 18:02:24,2025-10-24 12:41:42,0.6

Conservatives block necessary developments in many ways now and since many years, which now hurts the economy more and more.

Mainly because they are backed by the fossil fuel industry, which of course don't want to give up their profits.

Yet thanks to populism , conservatives are able to put the blame on the left / green and they use simple solutions which is easy to follow for especially people with lower education levels. Also they  divide people to hate someone weaker, like immigrants, even if their voters mainly live in the places with the lowest immigration shares.

Add to it that Russia is destabilizing western democracies with their support for authoritarian parties and bot farms.

Another ingredient: Social media algorithms pushing rightwing content and misinformation far more because it generates more clicks, more traction and more profit.

And last but not least, the EU really f*c*ed up their asylum system and didn't change it for too long. I think just last year they agreed on a new reform which should improve everything, but this was like 10 years overdue.",5,2025-10-23 18:02:24,2025-10-24 23:33:21,0.85

PoliticalDiscussion,hot,Do you see similar patterns in US politics where leaders use family protection language to justify removing democratic input?,"Recent research examined speeches by India's Modi and Hungary's Orbán from 2014 to 2019, documenting how both leaders use family metaphors when implementing authoritarian policies. The findings raise may have some similar rhetorical patterns appear in American politics.

When Modi's government shut down internet in Kashmir for 18 months and detained political leaders, he called Kashmiris brothers who needed reintegration into the family of the nation. He framed it as love and affection while implementing the longest internet shutdown in a democracy.

When Orbán created border hunter forces against refugees, he told them they were protecting homeland, homes, women, children and parents. The focus was on family protection rather than enemy defense.

The researchers argue this differs from traditional strongman rhetoric, and instead of us versus them, affected populations stay included rhetorically but lose practical rights. It functions like family hierarchy where the head of household decides rather than democratic process.

Modi described revoking Kashmir's autonomy as expressing the love and enthusiasm of the people, though Kashmiris themselves had no say. Both leaders invoke pride, love and familial duty to legitimize policies that bypass democratic accountability.

The study notes both draw heavily on post 9/11 counterterrorism discourse about masculine state protection, a framework that originated in American politics after September 11th and spread globally.

When American leaders talk about protecting children, defending the American way of life, or securing communities, does that language function similarly to bypass normal democratic debate? Is framing policy as family protection more politically effective than traditional security rhetoric?

The US State Department condemned this action, calling it an ""irresponsible"" act that disrupts the operations of private companies and undermines US-South Korea cooperation aimed at revitalizing the US shipbuilding and manufacturing industries.

What impact will this have on US-South Korea-China relations? Could China's sanctions hinder cooperation between South Korea and the US in the shipbuilding industry?

Republicans are the ones who passed massive tax cuts for the rich. Trump was the one who ran constant identity politics and culture war ads last year. 

But the opposite message has trickled down, because conservatives have put in the work for decades now to build a media operation that is explicitly conservative, while liberals have relied on working the traditional media, which is now being bought up by conservatives. Ditto for social media, the major outlets are owned by people who are at least sucking up to Trump, if not outright campaigned for him in the fall, and they have control over the algorithms on their platforms.

PoliticalDiscussion,hot,"What policies do Democrats need to embrace to win over conservative, working class, and rural voters?","I’m curious about a trend I’ve noticed. A lot of working class, rural, and conservative voters often say in social media comments that Trump’s win was more about the Democrats loss.

One thing I notice is a lot of anger about assertions that Trump voters are at all motivated by bigotry (race, gender, immigration status, etc.).

Many argue that that's a crutch and the real reasons squarely fall on the shoulders of Democrats and the multi-generational arc that the party:

* stopped prioritizing working class voters
* abandoned working class policy
* dismiss/categorize people as racist/bigoted/ignorant
* focus too much on ""identity politics""
* bailed out Wall Street and got too close to corporations
* cater mainly to the wealthy, elite, and upper middle class
* use language like ""flyover states"" and clearly feel superior to working class, rural areas.

If you consider yourself a working class conservative or former Democrat, I’d really like to hear your perspective. Instead of another long, drawn out debate about any of the above, I'm more interested in the future:

**What specific policies, positions, or platforms would you need to see to consider voting for left or Democratic candidates?**

This isn’t rhetorical, I’m writing an essay about the rise of anti-democratic values and the erosion of community, and I want to viewpoints from rural, working class, and former democratic voters. But to do that, I need to understand the mental paradigm.

It would be most helpful if you focused less on what democrats/progressives/leftists have done wrong, and more on what concrete policy positions they could take to get it right.

Because that just devolves into arguments, which I'm not interested in at all.

It would be much appreciated if you’d like to share which specific Trump policies or positions you actually supported, as many of his supporters will say they only agree with a small number of his policies without specifying which ones. Thank you.

How could such an amendment be structured?",57,50,7,"The biggest issue is that there’s no definition for what a gerrymandered district is versus what a fair district is.  Districting is entirely subjective.  

If a state is 75% white and 25% black, is the goal to have 4 districts that are all perfectly divided so they are each 75% white and  25% black? Or is the goal to have 3 100% white districts and 1 100% black district? Somewhere in the middle? Where in the middle? If people move in and move out, do you shift the boundaries to maintain the exact same proportional makeup? 

People look at maps and get bent out of shape about the weird shapes. But land doesn’t vote, people do. And some of those weird shapes are intended to keep culturally or economically similar people together (whether that’s good or bad is debatable). 

You could set out to draft a law that lays out a programatic solution for how districts should be defined. But the variables in that program will be inherently subjective and therefore biased.  I think this might be better than what we have now, but if one of the parties creates a new law that adjusts the variables they now have the ability to influence the districting of every state all at once which is risky.  

The best answer is to dramatically increase the number of seats in the house. And then to implement ranked choice voting everywhere.  Those two changes alone would make partisan gerrymandering kind of pointless.",58,2025-10-21 15:55:07,2025-10-22 05:13:35,0.0

How could such an amendment be structured?",57,50,7,"Gerrymandering is about political power, it’s about creating districts that maximize a given party’s number of seats. It has been done by both sides. The current use is at issue because before the mid 90’s typically districts were only redrawn after a census, since the number of seats in the House is set by a 1929 law, so it would be easier to change the law than the Constitution; however that then changes the electoral college which alters the math for electing the President.  The Electoral college has changed over time, and the states could alter the process by changing how they apportion electoral votes, instead of a winner take all approach, which puts power in a few states, if all states went to an apportioned system, the math for electing the President would be very different. But the districts, are what determines House seats, and control of that branch of the federal government, Senate is a statewide election so districts don’t really matter, so gerrymandering only impacts House seats and the President. 
Gerrymandering is not actually racially biased, it becomes that way because most black Americans are Democrats; and independents make up around 25% of all voters, which is within the margins of almost every election, so they can’t be gerrymandered, because they have no party affiliation, it’s the independents that more often than not determine the outcome of elections, and people who understand our system know that’s where the rubber meets the road, gerrymandering is really just a smokescreen, and also vote counting must be observable by the public to insure a fair count.",1,2025-10-21 15:55:07,2025-10-22 06:55:19,-0.1

 look at ICE act without oversight, no one should have the authority to be badgeless, masked up and kidnap people in unmarked cars...

* There was this article that authoritarians consolidate power by taking control of the judiciary, intelligence agencies, and the military. It seems Trump has already gained significant influence over the judiciary and intelligence communities. The military is harder to control since he cannot easily install loyalists. That is likely where he will have some of his focus. His recent meetings with senior generals may be part of an effort to identify and remove those who would not follow his orders. He also appears to be using ""terrorism"" as a pretext to involve the military in political matters. The Venezuela move fits that pattern. He may soon use similar tactics against Americans. The deployment of the National Guard seems to serve the same purpose. It could help him interfere with future elections, damage the relationship between the military and the public, and push the country further toward militarization.
* The midterm elections are a crucial milestone. If Democrats regain even partial control of Congress, they can push back more effectively. That is why Trump is so determined to support gerrymandering and suppress the vote.
* Controlling media, journalism, and academia is another front. Trump continues to attack these institutions to silence opposition and shape public perception.
* Internationally, he is building relationships with like-minded leaders. Argentina is one example. These alliances help him and the Republican Party strengthen their position at home too.
* Economically, Trump is trying to bring tech companies and major businesses under his influence. That has a direct impact on policy. For example, social media platforms may feel pressure to silence voices critical of him.
* You can’t rely on the idea that Trump’s policies will eventually cross a line and trigger widespread backlash. The usual analogy is the “boiling frog”; people adjust to losing their rights more easily than they think.
* Studying Hungary under Viktor Orbán (and Project 2025) is probably one of the ways to understand and prepare for Trump’s approach to power. Many of the policies Trump is pushing closely mirror Orbán’s playbook.

These are some areas where Trump appears to be consolidating power. They are also the same areas where the public must remain alert and push back against his authoritarian ambitions.",12,2025-10-17 15:34:57,2025-10-18 20:15:50,0.65

Journalism was imperfect, biased, and often incomplete but the overall purpose of it was to reflect what was happening. After a major event like the Oklahoma City bombing, Columbine, 9/11, etc all media acknowledge the same set events. 

Today media is about attention. Influencers, not journalists, dominate the information space. Influencers don't seek to be informative. They just seek attention. After events today like Jan 6th, COVID, etc the public no longer gets the same basic set of information. Depending on which media one follows they are seeing wildly different information. 

Everyone's media diet is different and individually curated. We are all getting information from a different combination of Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Reddit, Cable News, X, etc.  Most people presume podcasters are as informed as the actual credited press. Just asking questions is treated as more important than having experience. 

Traditional media died. People stopped buying newspapers, cut the TV cords, turned off the radios, etc decades ago. There isn't a market for truth journalism today. No one can afford to just spend 6 months researching a story for a single article or report. One needs to be out there everyday with a hot take mixing it up on social media. 

Depending on which media one engages with one currently thinks Portland Oregon is a dangerous place on the brink of collapse from homelessness and crime or they believe things are normal in Portland and reports of chaos are massive exaggerations. Same goes for Los Angeles, Washington DC, Chicago, etc. 

I worked in San Francisco for several years in the early 2000's. Currently live elsewhere. Back in 2023 I went back to San Francisco for a couple weeks for a work related event. I was nervous. I had seen enormous amounts of media that San Francisco had become a dangerous place full of drugs, homelessness, and crime. That the streets were full of poop and people had to just park with their windows down to avoid break-ins. 

I felt embarrassed once I got to San Francisco. I was a little ashamed that I had believed the propaganda. San Francisco was cleaner and nicer than it had been the years I spent there a couple decades ago. The difference between the on the ground reality from garbage I had been shown in media was staggering. Just totally divorced from reality. It was so shocking that I have since become pretty negative about our future.",161,2025-10-17 13:21:49,2025-10-18 07:19:06,0

Studies are mounting that conservatism is the political expression of pathological selfishness, greed, hate, and utter lack of empathy for any not in the ""in"" group (and some who are).

There's a disconnect in them like in some hard autistic and/or very young children--an utter inability to understand that other humans are separate and real with feelings and lives outside of how they relate to the observer.  Another ex same guy:  Has $25k worth of guns and safes, but also complains when hearing that FEMA agents were carrying when going to certain places.  ""Rules for thee, not for me"" is their driving force.

My impression is that there has been a gradual, decades-long deterioration in trust and civility that has been significantly worsened by Trump's inflammatory remarks over the past decade.  
   
Although there were still strong political disagreements among Americans in the 60s, 70s, and 80s, my impression is that there was a stronger sense of shared national identity and more engagement with institutions that foster civil society (e.g., labor unions, churches, rotary clubs, local governmental organizations, proverbial bowling leagues, etc.). There are several reasons that have probably contributed to this phenomenon. First, globalization and increased competition between multinational corporations has alienated most Americans from their labor and made many feel insecure about their economic prospects, resulting in more selfish behavior. Second, social taboos around moral vs. immoral behavior have changed significantly (e.g., acceptability of drug consumption, conventions around family structure and sexuality), which has been very liberating for many individuals, but has also arguably resulted in social strife (as a traditional role or social status becomes unattainable) and polarization between the sexes. Third, technology-enabled cultural changes, particularly regarding smartphone and social media use, have made individuals lonelier, by substituting more parasocial relationships for real-life social interactions, and fostered a culture of addiction and anxiety. Fourth, right-wing political and media leadership (starting with Newt Gingrich and Rush Limbaugh in the 90s, but escalating via divisive figures such as Mitch McConnell, Sarah Palin, Glenn Beck, Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter, etc., and ultimately culminating in Trump's rise within the GOP) has resulted in an escalation of political rhetoric that cannot be easily racheted back down, breaking previously existing political norms. Fifth, feeling isolated and powerless, a subset Americans on both the Left and the Right of the political spectrum have embraced identity politics, which provides a ready-made tribal/quasi-religious identity and sense of social belonging, provided one accepts the associated dogma. (The rhetoric around George Floyd and Charlie Kirk being saints or martyrs is emblematic of this.) Sixth, influencer culture, online provacateurs, and disinformation campaigns orchestrated by Russia have had helped to keep Americans' attention on the most divisive and polarizing issues of the day (e.g., transgender rights, Palestine, incidents of gun violence), instead of on issues of mutual concern and shared experience that might help serve as an off-ramp.  
   
So, to sum up, I think there have been fundamental shifts in U.S. culture that will not be reversed easily, and I think people who feel threatened and insecure in their own socioeconomic status are less willing to be generous when it comes to helping others.",21,2025-10-17 13:21:49,2025-10-18 09:23:44,0.6

I have heard of the Guardian Angels, and like the idea of unarmed community policing but I've never heard about this guy until this race.

Cuomo did even worse than I thought he would. He had canned responses that he kept hammering at even when it didn't make sense to do so. Before the debate I thought he was a dildo and he did nothing to disabuse me if that notion.

Mamdani had his shit together, but I'm skeptical that he can accomplish his goals unless he gets like 60% of the vote.

Best guess: Based off historical precedence, nobody will carry the torch. Trump most likely will lead MAGA as long as he is alive. If he's gone, that will cause a power vacuum where his prodigies (Vance, Jr, etc) try to take the head position, likely splitting MAGA into factions. Meanwhile, since MAGA is basically a cult of personality, the base will mostly collapse and dissipate without a figurehead. The US will never be like North Korea, despite how strong the focus is around Trump, it doesn't extend to his family, so it cant be easily passed on. Very few states successfully transfer power like that. Usually its one figurehead and when they leave, maybe their chosen successor lasts a few years (if put in power at all) befor being ousted.

I think Trump is the Republican Stalin.  Ruthlessly suppressing dissent, demanding absolute loyalty, paranoid of traitors while backstabbing anyone who steps an inch out of line, etc.  The instant Trump dies, I believe conservatives trusted by the right wing public will release blistering tell-all stories revealing rampant corruption.

Five years after Trump is gone, he will become anathema. A charismatic, friendly, folksy, conservative leader will come to the front on the Republican party and will give a speech like Krishchev gave denouncing Stalin.

2. He's bad at some things but good at others and it nets out to a slight positive.

3. He's bad at most things but the one or two issues I really care about are being handled well.

So it doesn't necessarily correlate.

Voters have been unhappy for a long time and it's not just with Trump, either. Approval ratings seem like they've been in the toilet all around for the last 10 years. It's an interesting phenomenon.

A lot of people chalk this up to tribalism (people will support their candidate even if they're not doing a great job) but it could even be the opposite of tribalism for all we know. For example, what if people are just more comfortable criticizing their side? Maybe some of these people were just grumbling in the past but didn't show it. That might actually be a good thing that they will express it. It could also be a factor that politics is so polarizing and nasty that everything just kind of tastes bad. I don't truly know but it's not something we can quickly conclude either way. It's interesting to think about though. Either way, it's probably time to re-evaluate how approval polling factors into our perceptions of politics given that obviously many people on both sides are unhappy yet continue to throw support behind candidates.",6,2025-10-13 18:26:37,2025-10-14 14:14:27,0

Obviously lots of Presidents have wanted to test their diplomacy mettle on Middle Eastern conflict (in various ways....) so it's really nothing new necessarily, and most of the time it doesn't actually succeed, but it's rarely held against them unless it somehow directly impacts Americans themselves. Otherwise it's just a swing and a miss on a topic that many people have swung at and many people have missed.

There may be other reasons to make these kinds of announcements, such as putting pressure on both parties to keep the deal solid. Israel-Hamas deals have a way of breaking down fairly quickly, usually with both sides pointing the finger at the other for blame as to who broke it first, so it's possible that making such high-visibility statements are a way of putting pressure on both parties to chill until the deal is done.

This is Stephen Miller influencing Trump.

Stephen Miller *hates* immigrants. And he *hates* democrats for not hating immigrants enough. It’s hard to really describe how so much history has lead to this point, but Stephen Miller is feeding a barely there Trump all sorts of crazy shit to justify his actions against non-white people. 

Here’s a [recent article](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/stephen-miller-accidentally-says-discussing-195209210.html) where Miller uses the first person possessive of who’s actually deploying the national guard. 

They are betting on the citizens of the cities to react faster than courts can respond to the legality. They can then use that reaction as justification for more force. Even if the original justification was a lie. As the spiral continues they amass more executive power resulting in the idea behind the unitary executive theory. 

The more of a national emergency they create the more power they get. Like the government shutdown. 

They push through a bill that’s going to take healthcare away from millions of Americans. The Dems push back and say “no way, we’ll fight this.” And they do. 

But when the government shuts down, the executive branch gets more power to do reductions in workforce (RIFs). 

They are laying off workers (legally or not, I’m not sure) that they wouldn’t have been able to without the chaos *they created*. 

And that’s the plan. Push as hard as you can until they push back. And then use that as justification to escalate their actions. Rinse and repeat.",20,2025-10-12 07:46:33,2025-10-13 01:35:49,0.9

Meaning they're not stuck with a two party system and/or in gerrymandered or propaganda hell.

Like you said, democracy only works with an informed populace so education, especially a well funded public education system is important. 

Democracy doesn't work when the political party in power does the things above. Cutting public education spending, gerrymandering to ensure they do not lose, only two parties to vote for so there is not really a choice, getting help from corporate media to propagandise the population for their unpopular agenda. Just to name a few.

Working democracies, the enviable ones, usually do not have any of these. They have a strong public education system, they have a publicly funded news broadcaster, they have an independent body that draws up electoral districts and they've usually moved on from first past the post to something better like proportional representation or ranked choice voting.

Other problems I'd consider problematic. Is money = speech and insider trading. The capture of government by corporate interests/lobbyists. 

Just to address the benevolent dictator thing. A lot of people seem to want a benevolent dictator because they think it would allow one person to do a lot of good. I don't think it's a good idea because if history is anything to learn from, there has been more dictators that killed many people than benevolent dictators. Getting a benevolent dictator then having them step down is (I think) putting all your money on green on a roulette wheel.

PoliticalDiscussion,hot,Is Idaho’s new Qatar Air Force facility a smart alliance—or another example of misplaced trust?,"Fox News’ Pete Hegseth recently announced that Qatar will fund new facilities for its pilots to train at Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho. The news instantly blew up online—some on the right called it a “Muslim invasion,” while some on the left claimed it was Trump’s payback for past business favors.

The reality, though, is more complicated. Qatar already hosts one of America’s largest overseas military bases, Al Udeid, which protects vital shipping routes and U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf. They’ve also played a key role in brokering the recent Israel–Hamas peace deal. This new Idaho facility is under U.S. control, just like the existing Singapore Air Force training program, which has been in place since 2008.

Still, the debate raises tough questions:

* Should the U.S. be deepening partnerships with nations that once funded groups tied to extremism?
* Is this a sign of progress—turning former adversaries into allies—or of naïveté?
* How do we separate fact from rage-bait when social media narratives on both sides distort the story?",193,179,14,[removed],116,2025-10-10 23:22:45,2025-10-11 06:26:25,0

* How do we separate fact from rage-bait when social media narratives on both sides distort the story?",193,179,14,"This arrangement seems legitimate for several reasons. It builds on a $12 billion deal signed in 2017 where the U.S. agreed to provide aircraft and U.S.-based training to Qatar meaning the Trump administration is following through on an Obama-era agreement rather than creating something new.

There's also clear precedent for this type of arrangement, as Mountain Home AFB has already hosted Singapore's Air Force F-15 fighter jets since 2009 as part of a planned 25-year training program showing that training allied nations' pilots at U.S. bases is common practice.

The relationship is reciprocal as well—Qatar hosts the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base, which currently houses about 8,000 American troops one of America's most important military installations in the Middle East.

Finally, Qatar, along with the United States and Egypt, helped mediate the cease-fire negotiations between Israel and Hamas , demonstrating their role as a diplomatic partner in regional stability efforts.

The Obama administration officially approved the F-15 sale to Qatar in **November 2016**, during the final months of Obama's presidency [The War Zone](https://www.twz.com/11564/timing-of-qatar-finally-signing-12-billion-f-15-deal-is-wildly-controversial)[NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/qatar-buys-12b-u-s-jets-days-after-trump-says-n772691). However, the actual deal wasn't formally signed until **June 2017**, which was several months after Trump took office in January 2017.

So the timeline looks like this:

1. **Years of negotiation** (likely 2014-2016): The deal was discussed and negotiated over several years
2. **November 2016**: Obama administration gives final approval
3. **January 2017**: Trump becomes president
4. **June 2017**: Deal is formally signed under Trump administration

This is actually quite common with major international defense deals—they often take years to negotiate and frequently span multiple presidential administrations. The State Department, Pentagon, and other agencies have to review and approve these sales, which is a lengthy process.",68,2025-10-10 23:22:45,2025-10-11 06:07:43,0.0

Politically, the United States is in a death spiral. The party in charge has ceded power to a cabal of incompetents. It's stunning to watch, really.

At any point, they could step forward, yank the orange lunatic out of the pilot's seat and pull the plane up, but instead, they guard the flight deck.

Societally, we mostly agree on stuff. We're honestly not nearly as divided as the media and pundits would have us believe, but politics don't reflect the will of the people, so we get the death spiral.

> 2- do you feel that there is room for nuance and political conversations anymore or do you think most people feel forced to pick aside?

I don't think most people are informed enough to appreciate nuance and that's on both sides.

The fact we have influencers and what they're calling an ""attention economy"" should drive that point home. Memes are > than nuance in America.

> 3- do you have any sort of political comment that you want to give?

Regardless of party, I'd suggest people elevate candidates who are trying to make things better in some way. Maybe they're campaigning to turn an unused industrial site into a park, or lower the price of insulin, they're trying to work for the people.

Ignore candidates running on grievance and outrage.

Extremely pessimistic.

I think the pendulum is going to swing back to the left. The lunatic is doing immeasurable damage and people will notice, but I don't think the left is in any position to step in and govern effectively. Democrats are on their back foot, and have little party unity or common direction.

Look at their treatment of Mamdani.

Also take a hard look at wealth and power the world over. Aside from Bill Gates and mosquito nets, do you see the rich and powerful giving two shits for their fellow man? Do they raise the alarm over Gaza, Ukraine, Venezuelan boats, bone saws in the Turkish Embassy, the gutting of USAID?

No, they pal around with Epstein and MBS at Davos and Mar-a-Lago. And that matters, because at the end of the day, regardless of which party holds the government, they don't generally work for us. Democrats are better, but I don't hear anything about a Project 2028.

Analogous to 1930s Germany, either just before the Nazi takeover or just after it. I do not believe the right, nor the aristocrats they serve, have any intention of making life better for the working class.

>2- do you feel that there is room for nuance and political conversations anymore or do you think most people feel forced to pick aside? 

There's always room for nuance and political discussions, but that can only occur when both parties are engaging in good faith. I don't think that's possible with people who believe in objective falsehoods.

And would having parties that adhere to those positions actually help to keep American politics from becoming extremely, sharply divided?",30,23,7,"Every country has its own set of beliefs which flows into what they define as ""conservative"" or ""progressive"" reflecting the dominating set of values they've grown up with. But the basic patterns behind the parties you describe exist in the US as well, they just have a different brand and Americans take about it differently.

The US has what is the equivalent to Christian Democracy with the Republicans and the Christian Evangelicals. The big difference is how loud the more extreme positions get attention in the US media landscape. If you took the time to look deeper into a Christian Democratic party in other countries, you'll find a strong opposition to abortion in religious grounds, etc. just like in the US. Their voice isn't as loud in other Western countries because they weren't a target of religious immigration and didn't go several rounds of religious awakening. 

The weak socialist movement in the US is a combination of religious conservatism, American ""rugged man"" values and the incredible prosperity the US experienced in lieu of two world wars. If you look at the period before WW1 and between the wars, you can find a fairly robust socialist movement resulting in Roosevelt's New Deal who managed to be voted into presidential office 4 times, often in landslides. This historic unparalleled and never repeated feat (which prompted Congress to pass amendment limiting presidential terms to two) was possible because of the American version of socialism with the Democratic party.

After WW2, the US enjoyed incredible prosperity and people didn't feel they needed more socialism, especially in light of the Cold War conflict and the Red Scare where ""socialism"" mutated into ""Russian Style Dictatorship"" in the mind of most Americans. While American prosperity has suffered repeated shocks - eg 70s oil crisis which resulted in the rise of Ronald Reagan's brand of conservatism - the basic pattern still holds: overall prosperity is big enough to undermine a stronger socialist movement, the portrayal on Reddit non-withstanding. 

Additionally, the US voting system creates a bigger incentive to act independently of the party. That's a result of the Founding Fathers deep suspicion of parties which doesn't really recognize parties as institutions like in many other Western countries. It's much harder to enforce party discipline, so Republicans and Democrats typically represent loose coalitions of parties with their own agenda. This was on display prominently with the ""Tea Bag"" movement which was a part of the Republican party. This results in a more ""darwinistic"" and less ideological party platform.

If you look at current politics in the US, the increased inflation has created stronger polarization but has not changed the basic pattern in US politics - it essentially boils down to ""continue to create prosperity by what worked in the 50s vs breaking past patterns and try something new by acting more collectively"". Currently the electorate has decided ""back to the 50s"" is their preference. Until the pain effects more people to the point where they think the current system will not continue to provide above average benefits, they we'll probably continue down that road.",15,2025-10-11 03:37:57,2025-10-11 22:21:06,0

I think it's best to start with the art side, where we get stuff like Picasso and jazz. The idea is ""we don't have to follow how things were done before."" They looked at the good things from the past, but didn't feel beholden to artificial constraints.

Politics followed a similar trend in terms of casting aside the aristocracy and social rigidity. Pre-Modernism, people had a place where they fit into society, there was little social/economic mobility, and people kinda just accepted their place.

With Modernism, people rejected that old way of thinking. That left two obvious choices for how to rethink society, both rooted in equality. One says that however you start out, you should be free to make of yourself whatever you can. The other says that the system should be designed to take care of everyone rather than propping of a small number at the expense of the many. Capitalism and Socialism.

Why did the US go one way and Europe the other? Probably has a lot to do with the vast resources the US has. Capitalism is an easier story to sell. Probably also a racial and ethnic component, harder to get disparate groups to want to pull together.

How strong is the USA's argument for moral superiority?",0,0,0,"I think your question is loaded. Moral superiority depends what you consider moral and exactly that's where the difference is in the countries you mentioned. Saudi Arabia views the way we allow porn and violence on TV, the music we listen to and letting women walk around with so much flesh visible morally corrupt. China focuses more on the benefits for the community and the respect of elders and views the way we treat our old people despicable. 

From a Western moral point of view, the US is miles ahead of both states. As an inheritor of European culture, if you debate the morality by European standards, you'll find that certain countries focus on different aspects. The US focuses on individual liberty while Germany for example focuses on risk minimization by collective action. It's hard to debate who is ""morally superior"" in that context. 

The issue starts when you start treating Saudi Arabian moral code as equal to Western moral code or you lean into ""being superior"" because of your moral code. Both paths are wrong in my view. If you equalize their moral code you are essentially giving up your own moral code without replacing it. If you act as if you were superior, people will pick up on your haughty behavior and you essentially do nothing else except telling the others what they are doing wrong the whole day - hardly a way to inspire change.

PoliticalDiscussion,hot,Could Riots Lead to “Plenary Authority”?,"TL;DR:
Riots or widespread violence could give the federal government legal grounds to invoke the Insurrection Act, potentially removing one of the last independent checks on executive power and giving Trump what his advisers have called “plenary authority” over the military (as referenced by Stephen Miller on CNN, Oct 2025 https://transcripts.cnn.com/show/cnc/date/2025-10-06/segment/10).


Could riots eliminate the last effective check on executive power and lead to “plenary authority” over the military?

In Donald Trump’s second term, we’ve seen an expansion of executive power and a growing willingness to use the National Guard in domestic situations. None of that is illegal, but it does edge closer to the line separating civilian and military authority, a line meant to keep power balanced.

Normally, several checks and balances exist to prevent overreach:

	•	Judicial oversight

	•	Congressional control

	•	Independent federal agencies like the DOJ or FBI

	•	State and local governments who control their own National Guards and police forces

Right now, most of those checks are under tight republican control including a Supreme Court majority (6-3), control of Congress (senate 53-45 and house 219-214) and key agencies (DOW led by Pete Hegseth and FBI led by Kash Patel). That alignment doesn’t automatically mean abuse of power, but it does mean fewer internal barriers to centralized decision-making.

That leaves state and city governments as some of the last practical checks on federal overreach. But tensions between state and federal authority, especially around immigration and public safety, are already testing how much independence governors and mayors really have.

Under normal circumstances, the Posse Comitatus Act prevents federal troops from engaging in domestic law enforcement. It’s one of the few remaining bright lines between the military and civilian life. But the Insurrection Act can override it. If unrest or riots are declared an “insurrection,” the President can lawfully overrule the Posse Comitatus Act and deploy active-duty troops inside the U.S., bypassing state and local resistance.

That’s why widespread rioting would be especially dangerous right now: it could provide the legal and political pretext to invoke the Insurrection Act — temporarily suspending the limits that keep military power in check. Yesterday, Stephen Miller on CNN stated that the administration won a case to federalize the CA national guard and “Under Title 10 of the U.S. Code, the president has plenary authority” before cutting himself off. Title 10 describes the responsibilities and control of the US military and “plenary authority” means full, unchecked power. 

To be clear, a full “military takeover” is extremely unlikely. The U.S. still has multiple layers of accountability. But the more unrest there is, the easier it becomes to justify extraordinary measures that concentrate power in the executive branch.

So even in tense times, the safest and most democratic path remains peaceful protest, civic engagement, and restraint. Please do not resort to violence.

Except it is illegal; usage of National Guard troops (or any military branch) as law enforcement within the domestic territory of the United States have conditions that must be met for their deployment to be legally valid.

I mean, this is obvious given that violence will get a violent response. But one also should not assume that refraining from violence means that the president won't invoke the insurrection act, especially given that existing illegitimate deployments of the National Guard was done under the guise of stopping crime, which is arguably law enforcement regardless of whether or not troops are authorized to act in a law enforcement capacity based on a total mischaracterization of the cities they have been deployed in.

The President didn't deploy the National Guard in a good faith attempt to 'solve crime' ; we shouldn't expect him to invoke the insurrection act in good faith either; this administration has not acted as if it needs pretext to take power; it will just do it if it is threatened. I feel like we'll see the insurrection act invoked before the midterms regardless and this administration will cite election security as the justification or needing increased power because legal challenges have prevented it from 'stopping crime' depending on how close to the midterms it is invoked.

And again to state the obvious: This does not mean that we should feel like we have free reign to be violent, we shouldn't since violence is and always will be the last resort but that we should be realistic and not assume that a lack of violence or rioting means that we'll be safe from yet another power grab.",19,2025-10-08 14:47:34,2025-10-09 00:03:52,0.7
PoliticalDiscussion,hot,Could Riots Lead to “Plenary Authority”?,"TL;DR:
Riots or widespread violence could give the federal government legal grounds to invoke the Insurrection Act, potentially removing one of the last independent checks on executive power and giving Trump what his advisers have called “plenary authority” over the military (as referenced by Stephen Miller on CNN, Oct 2025 https://transcripts.cnn.com/show/cnc/date/2025-10-06/segment/10).


Could riots eliminate the last effective check on executive power and lead to “plenary authority” over the military?

In Donald Trump’s second term, we’ve seen an expansion of executive power and a growing willingness to use the National Guard in domestic situations. None of that is illegal, but it does edge closer to the line separating civilian and military authority, a line meant to keep power balanced.

Normally, several checks and balances exist to prevent overreach:

	•	Judicial oversight

	•	Congressional control

	•	Independent federal agencies like the DOJ or FBI

	•	State and local governments who control their own National Guards and police forces

Right now, most of those checks are under tight republican control including a Supreme Court majority (6-3), control of Congress (senate 53-45 and house 219-214) and key agencies (DOW led by Pete Hegseth and FBI led by Kash Patel). That alignment doesn’t automatically mean abuse of power, but it does mean fewer internal barriers to centralized decision-making.

That leaves state and city governments as some of the last practical checks on federal overreach. But tensions between state and federal authority, especially around immigration and public safety, are already testing how much independence governors and mayors really have.

Under normal circumstances, the Posse Comitatus Act prevents federal troops from engaging in domestic law enforcement. It’s one of the few remaining bright lines between the military and civilian life. But the Insurrection Act can override it. If unrest or riots are declared an “insurrection,” the President can lawfully overrule the Posse Comitatus Act and deploy active-duty troops inside the U.S., bypassing state and local resistance.

That’s why widespread rioting would be especially dangerous right now: it could provide the legal and political pretext to invoke the Insurrection Act — temporarily suspending the limits that keep military power in check. Yesterday, Stephen Miller on CNN stated that the administration won a case to federalize the CA national guard and “Under Title 10 of the U.S. Code, the president has plenary authority” before cutting himself off. Title 10 describes the responsibilities and control of the US military and “plenary authority” means full, unchecked power. 

To be clear, a full “military takeover” is extremely unlikely. The U.S. still has multiple layers of accountability. But the more unrest there is, the easier it becomes to justify extraordinary measures that concentrate power in the executive branch.

So even in tense times, the safest and most democratic path remains peaceful protest, civic engagement, and restraint. Please do not resort to violence.

Israel is currently successfully ignoring UN security council resolutions UNSCR 242, which prohibits territorial acquisition by war, and UNSCR 2334, which declares settlements in the Palestinian territories illegal. Mind you, these resoultions have been approved by the security council, thus with the consent of the US. Nevertheless, these violations do not produce any consequences for Israel because the US keeps shielding it.

The question is, how will zionism cope with the consequences of a genocide verdict? Will it be able to continue as before? Will the US allow Israel to ignore it, and will it continue to try to shield it against such verdict?",0,0,0,"Zionism will survive because Zionism, regardless of what anyone else will tell you the definition of Zionism is:
> a movement for (originally) the re-establishment and (now) **the development and protection of a Jewish nation in what is now Israel.**

Israel is going to continue to exist into the foreseeable future, and thus Zionism will continue along just fine.

If the Balfour Declaration happened today, I would be categorically against the colonization of the Levant by Europeans, but it’s a fait accomplit. It has happened.  International law favors the status quo.

I am for a two state solution where Palestinians have full control of Gaza and the West Bank.",8,2025-10-09 17:31:30,2025-10-09 21:14:29,0.4

Make it so that the house of representatives expands, so that the population of the last populous state is the baseline for one representative, and every state gets representation based on that, rounding percentages normally. 

So, Wyoming has about 580,000 people living there, so they get one rep. California has about 40 million people, so 40,000,000/580,000=68.96, so California gets 69 representatives, instead of the 52 they currently have. That makes the house more representative of the population, while leaving the Senate to represent the states. It would also make presidential elections more representative of the population without entirely removing the importance of individual states.

1) The proposed solution is unicorn-rainbow-fantasyland. ""Let's get rid of the electoral college"" is this: it would require the very states that benefit from it to vote to give up their own disproportionate power.

2) The proposed solution violates the First Amendment.

PoliticalDiscussion,hot,"In developed countries, why are warmer (southern) regions typically more conservative, while colder (northern) regions are typically more progressive? This pattern is seen across many major countries, including the US, Canada, UK, France, Germany, Sweden, Italy, Spain, Japan, and Australia.","Something I've noticed about political geography in developed countries is that warmer (southern) regions tend to be more conservative, while colder (northern) regions tend to be more progressive. Why is that? This pattern is remarkably consistent across major developed countries, though there are a few exceptions, and I'm less familiar with political geography in developing countries.

**US:**

The North/South divide in the US is hundreds of years old, dating back to even before the Civil War over slavery abolition in the Southern States, and resulted (initially) in Northern states backing the abolitionist Republicans, and Southern states backing the anti-abolitionist Democrats. Today, of course, the parties are ideologically reversed, with Northern states (e.g. New York and New Jersey) backing the more progressive Democrats, and Southern states (e.g. Texas and Florida) backing the more conservative Republicans. California is an exception here—despite being in the Southwest and having a warm climate, it backed the North in the Civil War, and today votes very strongly Democratic.

**Canada:**

The most progressive territories in Canada are the three Arctic territories of Nunavut, Northwest Territories, and Yukon, in the far north. All three territories are entirely represented federally and provincially by leftwing MPs and Premiers (i.e. NDP or Liberal MPs or Premiers), though due to local law, some of these offices are officially nonpartisan. Canada's ""southern"" provinces, which have a much milder climate, are much more diverse politically, and all of the Conservative Party MPs and Premiers which Canada has are in these provinces—there are 0 in the Arctic north.

**UK:**

The North/South divide in the UK is again hundreds (thousands?) of years old, and there are multiple North/South divides here, all of which follow the same progressive/conservative axis. Scotland is notably more progressive than England—whereas England has traditionally been dominated by the Conservative Party, Scotland has traditionally been dominated by the Labour Party, and more recently by the progressive and separatist SNP. There is a North/South divide within England too: Northern England (specifically, the ""Red Wall"") has traditionally voted for the more progressive Labour Party, whereas Southern England has traditionally voted for the Conservative Party. The obvious exception here is London, which is located in the South but votes heavily Labour. However, Southern England as a whole has still historically been dominated by the Conservatives.

**France:**

The French Riviera, with mainland France's warmest climate, also boasts its most conservative politics—most of the major cities in the region (e.g. Nice and Cannes) are led by conservative mayors, countering the typical urban/rural divide. The Riviera is also a stronghold for the far-right, with Le Pen's far-right National Front winning its first-ever local elections in Région Sud (in the late 20th century). France's progressive strongholds, by contrast but to no surprise, are in the colder north—Brittany and Paris are regarded as France's most progressive or liberal regions. An exception here is Normandy: while it is in the north and has historically been leftwing, in recent years Normandy has become a stronghold for the far-right.

**Germany:**

Germany's dominant and currently-ruling party, the Union, is in fact an alliance of two parties: the Christian Democratic Union and the more conservative Christian Social Union—the latter of which operates, unsurprisingly, only in the south. Bavaria, Germany's southernmost state, is also its most conservative, and has given the Christian Social Union a near-monopoly on power there since WWII. Even the Bavarian capital city of Munich is represented at the state and federal level by conservative politicians, countering the typical urban/rural divide. Germany's progressive strongholds, by contrast but to no surprise, are all cities in the north—these include Hamburg and Berlin, which traditionally have been represented by the more progressive parties SPD and Die Linke, respectively. The exception here is (North?-)East Germany; until recently, East Germany voted strongly for the leftwing parties SPD and Die Linke, but has now become a stronghold for the far-right AfD (excluding Berlin).

**Sweden:**

Moreso than in other countries, the map of Sweden's national elections makes it clear that there is a sharp north/south divide. [In this map of Sweden's 2022 national elections](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/2022-swedish-general-election-bloc-results.svg/1003px-2022-swedish-general-election-bloc-results.svg.png?20220915121237), red indicates victories for the progressive bloc, and blue indicates victories for the conservative bloc. The north/south progressive/conservative axis appears, bluntly, yet again.

**Italy:**

Again, moreso than in other countries, the map of Italy's elections makes it clear that there is a sharp north/south divide. In 1946, Italy voted in a referendum to abolish its monarchy and establish a Republic, [but while nearly every province in the north voted for Republic, nearly every province in the south voted to retain the monarchy](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Referendum_Istituzionale_1946_Distacco.svg/970px-Referendum_Istituzionale_1946_Distacco.svg.png?20210203213017). Northern Italy has historically been more progressive than the conservative, traditionalist south.

**Spain:**

Spain's two progressive strongholds are both in the colder north of the country: Catalonia and Basque Country. Both regions have strong separatist movements backed by progressive-leaning parties. Spain's conservative stronghold may come as a bit of a surprise—it is Madrid, the capital and largest city. Madrid, located far from the milder northern coastlines of Basque Country and Catalonia, is in Spain's steaming hot interior—and has been ruled continuously by the conservative party at both the local and regional level for decades. Looking farther south: Andalusia, the southernmost region of Spain, was the first place in the country to award the far-right party Vox with seats in parliament.

**Japan:**

The conservative LDP has ruled Japan for almost all of its democratic history, but it finds its strongest support in the warmer, more southern regions of the country (specifically, in the southern regions/islands of Chugoku, Shikoku, and Kyushu). Opposition parties have rarely ruled Japan, but the more left-leaning CDP finds its strongest support in the colder north (e.g. in Iwate Prefecture in northern Honshu island).

**Australia:**

In the Land Down Under, things are a bit upside-down: progressive parties and politicians perform best in the cooler south of the country, while conservative parties and politicians perform best in the hotter north. Australia's coldest and southernmost state, Tasmania, is also its most progressive—every single MP from the state is from the Labor Party. On the flip side: Australia's hottest and northernmost state, Queensland, is also its most conservative—in the last federal election, Queensland was the only state out of 6 where the progressive Labor Party failed to win a majority of the vote.

\---

Why does this pattern exist? It's remarkably consistent across major developed countries, though there are a few lonely exceptions (e.g. Poland and South Korea, which show a west-east left-right political divide, as opposed to a north-south one), and I'm not as familiar with political geography in developing countries.

Does it have to do with poverty and race? In the US, the South is poorer, and is home to many Blacks—which some people say is why the South is more conservative. However, I don't think this explanation works for other countries. For example, in the UK, Southern England is wealthier than both Northern England and Scotland, but Southern England is still more conservative. In Australia, the cooler south (e.g. Victoria) is where immigrants typically flock to, and is more racially diverse, but the most conservative part of the country is on the other end.

Why is that? This pattern is remarkably consistent across major developed countries, though there are a few exceptions, and I'm less familiar with political geography in developing countries.

**US:**

The North/South divide in the US is hundreds of years old, dating back to even before the Civil War over slavery abolition in the Southern States, and resulted (initially) in Northern states backing the abolitionist Republicans, and Southern states backing the anti-abolitionist Democrats. Today, of course, the parties are ideologically reversed, with Northern states (e.g. New York and New Jersey) backing the more progressive Democrats, and Southern states (e.g. Texas and Florida) backing the more conservative Republicans. California is an exception here—despite being in the Southwest and having a warm climate, it backed the North in the Civil War, and today votes very strongly Democratic.

**Canada:**

The most progressive territories in Canada are the three Arctic territories of Nunavut, Northwest Territories, and Yukon, in the far north. All three territories are entirely represented federally and provincially by leftwing MPs and Premiers (i.e. NDP or Liberal MPs or Premiers), though due to local law, some of these offices are officially nonpartisan. Canada's ""southern"" provinces, which have a much milder climate, are much more diverse politically, and all of the Conservative Party MPs and Premiers which Canada has are in these provinces—there are 0 in the Arctic north.

**UK:**

The North/South divide in the UK is again hundreds (thousands?) of years old, and there are multiple North/South divides here, all of which follow the same progressive/conservative axis. Scotland is notably more progressive than England—whereas England has traditionally been dominated by the Conservative Party, Scotland has traditionally been dominated by the Labour Party, and more recently by the progressive and separatist SNP. There is a North/South divide within England too: Northern England (specifically, the ""Red Wall"") has traditionally voted for the more progressive Labour Party, whereas Southern England has traditionally voted for the Conservative Party. The obvious exception here is London, which is located in the South but votes heavily Labour. However, Southern England as a whole has still historically been dominated by the Conservatives.

**France:**

The French Riviera, with mainland France's warmest climate, also boasts its most conservative politics—most of the major cities in the region (e.g. Nice and Cannes) are led by conservative mayors, countering the typical urban/rural divide. The Riviera is also a stronghold for the far-right, with Le Pen's far-right National Front winning its first-ever local elections in Région Sud (in the late 20th century). France's progressive strongholds, by contrast but to no surprise, are in the colder north—Brittany and Paris are regarded as France's most progressive or liberal regions. An exception here is Normandy: while it is in the north and has historically been leftwing, in recent years Normandy has become a stronghold for the far-right.

**Germany:**

Germany's dominant and currently-ruling party, the Union, is in fact an alliance of two parties: the Christian Democratic Union and the more conservative Christian Social Union—the latter of which operates, unsurprisingly, only in the south. Bavaria, Germany's southernmost state, is also its most conservative, and has given the Christian Social Union a near-monopoly on power there since WWII. Even the Bavarian capital city of Munich is represented at the state and federal level by conservative politicians, countering the typical urban/rural divide. Germany's progressive strongholds, by contrast but to no surprise, are all cities in the north—these include Hamburg and Berlin, which traditionally have been represented by the more progressive parties SPD and Die Linke, respectively. The exception here is (North?-)East Germany; until recently, East Germany voted strongly for the leftwing parties SPD and Die Linke, but has now become a stronghold for the far-right AfD (excluding Berlin).

**Sweden:**

Moreso than in other countries, the map of Sweden's national elections makes it clear that there is a sharp north/south divide. [In this map of Sweden's 2022 national elections](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/2022-swedish-general-election-bloc-results.svg/1003px-2022-swedish-general-election-bloc-results.svg.png?20220915121237), red indicates victories for the progressive bloc, and blue indicates victories for the conservative bloc. The north/south progressive/conservative axis appears, bluntly, yet again.

**Italy:**

Again, moreso than in other countries, the map of Italy's elections makes it clear that there is a sharp north/south divide. In 1946, Italy voted in a referendum to abolish its monarchy and establish a Republic, [but while nearly every province in the north voted for Republic, nearly every province in the south voted to retain the monarchy](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Referendum_Istituzionale_1946_Distacco.svg/970px-Referendum_Istituzionale_1946_Distacco.svg.png?20210203213017). Northern Italy has historically been more progressive than the conservative, traditionalist south.

**Spain:**

Spain's two progressive strongholds are both in the colder north of the country: Catalonia and Basque Country. Both regions have strong separatist movements backed by progressive-leaning parties. Spain's conservative stronghold may come as a bit of a surprise—it is Madrid, the capital and largest city. Madrid, located far from the milder northern coastlines of Basque Country and Catalonia, is in Spain's steaming hot interior—and has been ruled continuously by the conservative party at both the local and regional level for decades. Looking farther south: Andalusia, the southernmost region of Spain, was the first place in the country to award the far-right party Vox with seats in parliament.

**Japan:**

The conservative LDP has ruled Japan for almost all of its democratic history, but it finds its strongest support in the warmer, more southern regions of the country (specifically, in the southern regions/islands of Chugoku, Shikoku, and Kyushu). Opposition parties have rarely ruled Japan, but the more left-leaning CDP finds its strongest support in the colder north (e.g. in Iwate Prefecture in northern Honshu island).

**Australia:**

In the Land Down Under, things are a bit upside-down: progressive parties and politicians perform best in the cooler south of the country, while conservative parties and politicians perform best in the hotter north. Australia's coldest and southernmost state, Tasmania, is also its most progressive—every single MP from the state is from the Labor Party. On the flip side: Australia's hottest and northernmost state, Queensland, is also its most conservative—in the last federal election, Queensland was the only state out of 6 where the progressive Labor Party failed to win a majority of the vote.

Why does this pattern exist? It's remarkably consistent across major developed countries, though there are a few lonely exceptions (e.g. Poland and South Korea, which show a west-east left-right political divide, as opposed to a north-south one), and I'm not as familiar with political geography in developing countries.

Does it have to do with poverty and race? In the US, the South is poorer, and is home to many Blacks—which some people say is why the South is more conservative. However, I don't think this explanation works for other countries. For example, in the UK, Southern England is wealthier than both Northern England and Scotland, but Southern England is still more conservative. In Australia, the cooler south (e.g. Victoria) is where immigrants typically flock to, and is more racially diverse, but the most conservative part of the country is on the other end.

Why is that? This pattern is remarkably consistent across major developed countries, though there are a few exceptions, and I'm less familiar with political geography in developing countries.

**US:**

The North/South divide in the US is hundreds of years old, dating back to even before the Civil War over slavery abolition in the Southern States, and resulted (initially) in Northern states backing the abolitionist Republicans, and Southern states backing the anti-abolitionist Democrats. Today, of course, the parties are ideologically reversed, with Northern states (e.g. New York and New Jersey) backing the more progressive Democrats, and Southern states (e.g. Texas and Florida) backing the more conservative Republicans. California is an exception here—despite being in the Southwest and having a warm climate, it backed the North in the Civil War, and today votes very strongly Democratic.

**Canada:**

The most progressive territories in Canada are the three Arctic territories of Nunavut, Northwest Territories, and Yukon, in the far north. All three territories are entirely represented federally and provincially by leftwing MPs and Premiers (i.e. NDP or Liberal MPs or Premiers), though due to local law, some of these offices are officially nonpartisan. Canada's ""southern"" provinces, which have a much milder climate, are much more diverse politically, and all of the Conservative Party MPs and Premiers which Canada has are in these provinces—there are 0 in the Arctic north.

**UK:**

The North/South divide in the UK is again hundreds (thousands?) of years old, and there are multiple North/South divides here, all of which follow the same progressive/conservative axis. Scotland is notably more progressive than England—whereas England has traditionally been dominated by the Conservative Party, Scotland has traditionally been dominated by the Labour Party, and more recently by the progressive and separatist SNP. There is a North/South divide within England too: Northern England (specifically, the ""Red Wall"") has traditionally voted for the more progressive Labour Party, whereas Southern England has traditionally voted for the Conservative Party. The obvious exception here is London, which is located in the South but votes heavily Labour. However, Southern England as a whole has still historically been dominated by the Conservatives.

**France:**

The French Riviera, with mainland France's warmest climate, also boasts its most conservative politics—most of the major cities in the region (e.g. Nice and Cannes) are led by conservative mayors, countering the typical urban/rural divide. The Riviera is also a stronghold for the far-right, with Le Pen's far-right National Front winning its first-ever local elections in Région Sud (in the late 20th century). France's progressive strongholds, by contrast but to no surprise, are in the colder north—Brittany and Paris are regarded as France's most progressive or liberal regions. An exception here is Normandy: while it is in the north and has historically been leftwing, in recent years Normandy has become a stronghold for the far-right.

**Germany:**

Germany's dominant and currently-ruling party, the Union, is in fact an alliance of two parties: the Christian Democratic Union and the more conservative Christian Social Union—the latter of which operates, unsurprisingly, only in the south. Bavaria, Germany's southernmost state, is also its most conservative, and has given the Christian Social Union a near-monopoly on power there since WWII. Even the Bavarian capital city of Munich is represented at the state and federal level by conservative politicians, countering the typical urban/rural divide. Germany's progressive strongholds, by contrast but to no surprise, are all cities in the north—these include Hamburg and Berlin, which traditionally have been represented by the more progressive parties SPD and Die Linke, respectively. The exception here is (North?-)East Germany; until recently, East Germany voted strongly for the leftwing parties SPD and Die Linke, but has now become a stronghold for the far-right AfD (excluding Berlin).

**Sweden:**

Moreso than in other countries, the map of Sweden's national elections makes it clear that there is a sharp north/south divide. [In this map of Sweden's 2022 national elections](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/2022-swedish-general-election-bloc-results.svg/1003px-2022-swedish-general-election-bloc-results.svg.png?20220915121237), red indicates victories for the progressive bloc, and blue indicates victories for the conservative bloc.

**Italy:**

Again, moreso than in other countries, the map of Italy's elections makes it clear that there is a sharp north/south divide. In 1946, Italy voted in a referendum to abolish its monarchy and establish a Republic, [but while nearly every province in the north voted for Republic, nearly every province in the south voted to retain the monarchy](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Referendum_Istituzionale_1946_Distacco.svg/970px-Referendum_Istituzionale_1946_Distacco.svg.png?20210203213017). Northern Italy has historically been more progressive than the conservative, traditionalist south.

**Spain:**

Spain's two progressive strongholds are both in the colder north of the country: Catalonia and Basque Country. Both regions have strong separatist movements backed by progressive-leaning parties. Spain's conservative stronghold may come as a bit of a surprise—it is Madrid, the capital and largest city. Madrid, located far from the milder northern coastlines of Basque Country and Catalonia, is in Spain's steaming hot interior—and has been ruled continuously by the conservative party at both the local and regional level for decades. Looking farther south: Andalusia, the southernmost region of Spain, was the first place in the country to award the far-right party Vox with seats in parliament.

**Japan:**

The conservative LDP has ruled Japan for almost all of its democratic history, but it finds its strongest support in the warmer, more southern regions of the country (specifically, in the southern regions/islands of Chugoku, Shikoku, and Kyushu). Opposition parties have rarely ruled Japan, but the more left-leaning CDP finds its strongest support in the colder north (e.g. in Iwate Prefecture in northern Honshu island).

**Australia:**

In the Land Down Under, things are a bit upside-down: progressive parties and politicians perform best in the cooler south of the country, while conservative parties and politicians perform best in the hotter north. Australia's coldest and southernmost state, Tasmania, is also its most progressive—every single MP from the state is from the Labor Party. On the flip side: Australia's hottest and northernmost state, Queensland, is also its most conservative—in the last federal election, Queensland was the only state out of 6 where the progressive Labor Party failed to win a majority of the vote.

I'm interested in what this community's opinion on this topic is.",99,80,19,"In some ways you are sort of getting cause and effect mixed up, but you are right most countries have a North/South divide.

If you take the UK for example, if you lump the parties into ""Conservative"" and ""progressive"" and the country into ""north"" and ""south"" you get quite a neat picture like you describe. However it's fundamentally flawed.

It lends itself to looking at a geographic map and going ""hey look the bottom half is blue and the top half is red"". Or even in the case of England ""wow the entire of England is blue!"". It misrepresented where actual representatives are though.

For example, here is a geographic map of the UK general election results from 2010, in this election no party won more than half the seats in parliament:

https://www.libdemvoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/UK-Political-Map1-1.jpg

Just looking at that map, you'd think 66%+ of MPs were conservative.

This, on the other hand, is a map of the exact same results, but made based on constituency location not geography:

https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ9guGvhLOuMlKTy15pu6c6zDyopg59vaacwLU5kiq0eg&s=10

In this one the big diamond shape down the bottom is all the constituencies in London, which is mostly red. Since each of those hexagons represents roughly 60,000 people, it presents a much more balanced view because counting London as ""one place in the south"" when 10m out of 70m people live there but counting the south east as an entire region, which has slightly less people in it, is a bit mad.

Next there is the idea that the north is progressive and the south is conservative specifically. This analysis of voting patterns in the UK is, I'm sorry to say, about 15 years out of date, and I say that because I studied politics as a degree over 15 years ago and loads of stuff written about UK politics back then should have been thrown out by now.

Partisan politics always reflects the cleavages you have in society. In the UK, like most western democracies, those cleavages were traditionally economic, not social. The left wing parties were about taxing people and spending the money on the wider public, and the right wing parties were about not doing that. Obviously social conservatism is therefore a feature of parties that support the rich, because they got rich in the world exactly like it is, but the voting lines were primarily economic.

So what you have as a split is the North voting for economic policies that benefit the poor, and the South voting for economic policies that benefit the rich. This makes sense because the South is wealthier than the north.

However, now social progress/conservatism is a key cleavage, those voting patterns have shifted significantly. The next time one of these naps are done, what you're going to see is a lot of the north of England voting Reform, which is the hard right wing party here, and the only places that stay red will be the cities. The rich countryside will stay blue, largely, but big chunks of the south will go to reform too.

This clearly disproved the hypothesis that Northern regions are inherently more ""progressive"". There is no inherent progressive nature to Northern people, they are driven by whatever splits in society effect everyone.

So why was there historically that split? Economics, the north is poorer than the south. Poorer people tend to support change and public spending, rich people tend to support the status quo and low taxes. Scotland and Wales are sort of exceptions, because they were historically quite brutally pressed by the English and were left very poor by the English governments. This means even when the economic element is less important there's a cultural difference. 

You cite Italy as an example, but from my understanding of Italian politics they see something similar to the UK, where the cities tend to vote left, and the wealth countryside areas of the country vote right. The left wing parties are therefore most successful in Central Italy where the cities are, not the South. 

Finally, there is the question, what even is north or south in a country? It's a rarely based on geography or population. The end result is there's a line which rather splits the nation in two based on another already established split. I won't explain this when there's an excellent map men video that addresses it:

https://youtu.be/ENeCYwms-Cc?si=xmfPV3D8EZvN3--h

So in short there's no evidence that Northern regions of countries are just more progressive. There are splits, but often it's because we, as humans, have decided to draw a divide in the country between north and south at an point representing some other factor (e.g. Wealth) rather than based on anything empirical, and then ignore the bits that don't fit (e.g. London being very much the south sand voting left wing).",16,2025-10-07 02:55:08,2025-10-07 08:40:16,0
PoliticalDiscussion,hot,How will emerging multipolar dynamics reshape international institutions and global governance frameworks?,"As we observe shifts in the global balance of power, with rising economies gaining more influence while traditional powers maintain significant roles, questions arise about how international institutions might adapt.



Key areas to consider:



• The UN Security Council's composition and veto power structure, which reflects post-WWII realities

• Regional organizations (ASEAN, African Union, etc.) taking on greater roles in conflict resolution and governance

• International financial institutions like the IMF and World Bank potentially evolving to reflect changing economic weights

• Trade frameworks and how they accommodate different economic models

• Climate agreements and global health coordination in a more distributed power structure



Questions for discussion:



1. What specific reforms to international institutions would best reflect current global realities while maintaining effectiveness?



2. How can international cooperation be strengthened when powers have competing interests but shared challenges like climate change and pandemics?



3. Are regional organizations becoming more important than global ones for certain types of governance? What are the trade-offs?



4. How might newer international frameworks differ from 20th-century models in their structure and decision-making processes?

It feels like a lot of wars criss cross most of the criteria there. The Allied Forces did most of those things. The French entertained similar such conditions for Algerians. Holodmor is uniformly considered a Ukrainian genocide instead of a miscalculation like Bengali or Irish Famine oddly enough. A large percentage of Ingush and Kazakhs were subjugated to a similar fate but most do not recognize it as a genocide on them either....Indonesia massacred a 1/3 of the Timorese population, Turkey is guilty of all of the following transgressions towards Assyrians or Kurds. But Seyfo and the 90s ""counter-terrorism"" campaign against the PKK are not highlighted as genocides.",2,2025-10-07 23:43:04,2025-10-08 03:07:28,0

What are your thoughts?",0,0,0,">What are your thoughts?

I agree that the items listed here and the overall framework of what constitutes genocide are mostly valid.  

The bottom line of genocide is that it's a willful attempt to wipe out an entire nation and national culture.  It's considered worse than murder, since it doesn't just entail killing the physical body, but also any memory of who the people were and that they even existed at all.  

American generals say things like ""Bomb them back to the Stone Age.""  Condemning a country to live under Stone Age conditions would be tantamount to a death sentence, so even that could be seen as a possible intent to commit genocide.  

As far as making any kind of legal case, the prospect of someone actually arresting a world leader and charging them with crimes against humanity seems exceedingly remote.  In practice, the charge of genocide seems more an appeal to world opinion which carries no official or legal weight.  But it does carry some political weight - even if the U.S. veto power in the U.N. can override that.  

I think they got worked up by war fever, consumed by blind rage - similar to what possessed Americans just after 9/11.  It seems like some kind of ""temporary insanity"" which eventually goes away.",1,2025-10-07 23:43:04,2025-10-08 14:11:21,0.3

The original deal proposed was a shakedown. Zelensky basically said never going to happen. Bessent and Rubio were able to basically get Zelensky to do a symbolic concession by signing a deal that basically committed neither the US or Ukraine to anything. It was more or less a symbolic kissing of the ring that meant nothing. The whole visit was arranged probably more as a diplomatic display than a serious negotiation.

My read on the press conference was that it was going pretty well if a bit tense when Vance  saw an opening to purposefully sabotage it by feeding into Trump's ego. Zelensky really only half took the bait but it was enough. This I think is fairly revealing of the internal dynamics going on.

Rubio, Kellogg, and Bessent are all by most accounts fairly pro-Ukraine and want to navigate this minefield and figure out how to stroke Trump's ego while continuing as much support as possible to Ukraine. Trump is basically only concerned with stroking his ego and making money. He is much more interested in the idea of business opportunities in Russia and Ukraine and how much money this will make the US than any coherent idea of US interest. He likes Putin more than Zelensky but thats basically how he sees this deal. Vance on the other hand is really Russia's greatest ally in the US. Vance hates the European liberal democracies and sees the US exiting more comfortably in an alliance with christian conservative states like Russia. This is really I think a combination of two strains of conservative thought

The first is this sort of dumb realist argument that many conservatives are obsessed with of turning Russia into a US ally by granting it a sphere of influence in a global competition against China. Morality aside,  This will never work because Russia hates us, would basically collapse economically if it broke with China, and could never trust the US two party system to maintain that understanding. The second and more important fight though of course is that conservatives perceive their real enemy as the ""progressive order"" and thus undermining the cultural ties with other western liberal states is a feature not a bug.",226,2025-02-28 19:31:28,2025-02-28 19:44:57,0.7

PoliticalDiscussion,top,How is Trump Getting Away with Everything?," I’ve been following the Trump situation for years now, and I can't wrap my head around how he's managed to avoid any real consequences despite the sheer number of allegations, investigations, and legal cases against him. From the hush money scandal to the classified documents case, to the January 6th insurrection — it feels like any other politician would have been crushed under the weight of even *one* of these.

I get that Trump's influence over the Republican Party and the conservative media machine gives him a protective shield, but how deep does this go? Are we talking about systemic issues with the legal system, political corruption, or just strategic maneuvering by Trump and his team?

For context:  
📌 Trump was impeached *twice* — first for pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden, and then for inciting the Capitol riot — yet he was acquitted both times because Senate Republicans closed ranks.  
📌 The classified documents case (where Trump allegedly kept top-secret files at Mar-a-Lago) seemed like an open-and-shut case, yet it's been bogged down in procedural delays and legal loopholes.  
📌 The New York hush money case involved falsifying business records to cover up payments to Stormy Daniels — something that would likely land an average citizen in jail — but Trump seems untouchable.  
📌 The Georgia election interference case (pressuring officials to ""find"" votes) looks like outright criminal behavior, yet Trump is still able to campaign without serious repercussions.

📌 Trump's administration recently invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador, directly defying a judicial order halting such actions. The administration argued that verbal court orders aren't binding once deportation planes leave U.S. airspace, a stance that has left judges incredulous. 

📌Trump's recent actions have intensified conflicts with the judiciary, showcasing attempts to wield unchallenged presidential authority. For instance, he proceeded with deportations despite court blocks, reflecting a strategy of making bold decisions and addressing legal challenges afterward.

📌 In a landmark decision, the Supreme Court ruled that presidents have absolute immunity for acts committed within their core constitutional duties, and at least presumptive immunity for official acts within the outer perimeter of their responsibilities. This ruling has significant implications for holding presidents accountable for their actions while in office

It seems like Trump benefits from a mix of legal stall tactics, political protection, and public perception manipulation. But is the American legal system really that broken, or is there some higher-level political game being played here?

PoliticalDiscussion,top,How is Trump Getting Away with Everything?," I’ve been following the Trump situation for years now, and I can't wrap my head around how he's managed to avoid any real consequences despite the sheer number of allegations, investigations, and legal cases against him. From the hush money scandal to the classified documents case, to the January 6th insurrection — it feels like any other politician would have been crushed under the weight of even *one* of these.

I get that Trump's influence over the Republican Party and the conservative media machine gives him a protective shield, but how deep does this go? Are we talking about systemic issues with the legal system, political corruption, or just strategic maneuvering by Trump and his team?

For context:  
📌 Trump was impeached *twice* — first for pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden, and then for inciting the Capitol riot — yet he was acquitted both times because Senate Republicans closed ranks.  
📌 The classified documents case (where Trump allegedly kept top-secret files at Mar-a-Lago) seemed like an open-and-shut case, yet it's been bogged down in procedural delays and legal loopholes.  
📌 The New York hush money case involved falsifying business records to cover up payments to Stormy Daniels — something that would likely land an average citizen in jail — but Trump seems untouchable.  
📌 The Georgia election interference case (pressuring officials to ""find"" votes) looks like outright criminal behavior, yet Trump is still able to campaign without serious repercussions.

📌 Trump's administration recently invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador, directly defying a judicial order halting such actions. The administration argued that verbal court orders aren't binding once deportation planes leave U.S. airspace, a stance that has left judges incredulous. 

📌Trump's recent actions have intensified conflicts with the judiciary, showcasing attempts to wield unchallenged presidential authority. For instance, he proceeded with deportations despite court blocks, reflecting a strategy of making bold decisions and addressing legal challenges afterward.

📌 In a landmark decision, the Supreme Court ruled that presidents have absolute immunity for acts committed within their core constitutional duties, and at least presumptive immunity for official acts within the outer perimeter of their responsibilities. This ruling has significant implications for holding presidents accountable for their actions while in office

It seems like Trump benefits from a mix of legal stall tactics, political protection, and public perception manipulation. But is the American legal system really that broken, or is there some higher-level political game being played here?

First, everyone who opposes this stuff seems to be operating under this presumption that, at some point, there will be a hard stop somewhere. A line that, literally, cannot be crossed. Like ""Okay, he's saying all this stuff, but he can't actually go through with it. The courts will stop him."" and then the courts don't stop anything by enacting any real punishment, and people go on the news saying they'll openly defy the court, and people say ""Well, sure, but I guess nobody is putting their foot down because it's not that bad, or that illegal."" and they all wait for something, somewhere to stop things, or enact some kind of failsafe like a governor in a cars speedometer that slows you down if you go too fast.


Second, and this is the big one, I think anything that could've potentially derailed his political ambitions has been just ""not that bad"" enough to let him skate by. Things were always not nearly as bad as they could've been.The Access Hollywood tape, for example. Could've been much worse. I've heard people say much worse, for sure. But it was just ""not that bad"" enough for people to handwave it off. The pandemic, again, was only a respiratory virus that felt like the flu (that people were already familiar with) and the deaths that it caused were less dramatic than with something like, say, rabies where there's a really dramatic mental shift and a pretty dramatic death in a short window. If people were going insane in the street, refusing water, and you basically had to watch your family go feral and die in a week, that probably would not have caused the political division over vaccines. Jan 6, same thing. I think if it'd been an absolute bloodbath, if the shooting of Ashli Babbitt had caused an out and out firefight in the capital building, I think that would've been insane enough that politicians would've said okay, this is enough, we have to take a stand for it. But it was just ""not that bad"" enough in relation to what it could've been that people were not only fine with sweeping it under the rug, they basically rebranded it as a guided tour and everybody got pardoned.",86,2025-03-19 00:34:24,2025-03-19 02:18:39,0.6

These were her bullet points to look out for.

* **Strongman Leadership & Authoritarianism** A single leader or ruling elite consolidates power, often disregarding democratic norms. Institutions that provide checks and balances are weakened or dismantled.
* **Disregard for Truth & Manipulation of Reality** Leaders use lies, conspiracy theories, and propaganda to distort facts. The press is labeled as the “enemy of the people” to undermine independent journalism.
* **Exploitation of Nationalism & Division** Extreme nationalism is used to rally support, often by scapegoating minorities or outsiders. Society is divided into “us vs. them,” where certain groups are demonized.
* **Encouraging Violence & Suppressing Opposition** Fascist leaders condone or encourage violence against political opponents and critics. Protests and free speech are repressed through intimidation or force.
* **Corrupt Use of Power & Weakening of Institutions** Democratic processes, such as elections and judicial independence, are undermined. Loyalty to the leader is prioritized over competence and rule of law.
* **Contempt for Democracy & Individual Rights** Fascists see democracy as weak and inefficient, advocating for stronger, unchecked leadership. Rights such as free speech, privacy, and assembly are restricted.

I don't understand why people keep using hyperbole when talking about fascism. Everyone can see it but so many are afraid to admit it because they don't want it to be true. We are there.

Could that be the United States' future?",1737,1563,174,"Alright so here's what's happening that's in a ""fascist direction"" the way I see it.

First of all, Executive Orders are built on sand and a lot of the ones he signed just aren't enforceable. 

What \*is\* dangerous, though, are a few things:

1) Pardoning of Jan 6th defendants - This is a play to get the militias to do what he wants because now they owe him. These are your SS, your brownshirts, your vigilantes. This is what I'm primarily worried about.

2) The utter capitulation of legacy/corporate media - This was near-instant, and is unique to Trump's presidency. It bodes poorly for the ability of the opposition to coordinate and for everyday people to receive accurate and reliable information about what Trump is doing.

3) Hegseth/Patel/Gabbard - These people are in government just to do what Trump wants, and his ability to control the FBI and National Intelligence Services against the safety and security of the United States, as well as to prosecute opposition candidates and the people who investigated Jan 6th, is extremely dangerous. Hegseth is a bridge between the military and the militias, which makes him especially dangerous.

I would like to remark that no matter what anyone Trump nominated says in front of Congress, they are lying. We saw this with Brett Kavanaugh, and now literally anyone can say whatever they want to Congress (""No, I won't pursue Trump's political opponents..."" and what have you), get in, and face zero consequences. Patel \*will\* do Trump's bidding; he has a long and extensive history of conspiracy theories and buys in to Trump's grievances.

4) RFK Jr - This is a special case because his antivax stances are going to kill a lot of people, especially children, and Trump's own voters are uniquely vulnerable after the pandemic because they are also antivax. He's not so much fascist as just completely reckless and irresponsible.

5) Undocumented migrants - This one we've seen before, and it might be a trial run for something worse later. Texas has already promised use of its land to build \*ahem!\* *camps* to house migrants. It's worth noting that citizens, including military veterans, have been caught up in ICE's dragnet. Watch this space.",148,2025-02-01 00:09:16,2025-02-01 02:40:52,0.7

The reason, according to widespread reporting including the above, was that he wanted to run his campaign on there being chaos at the border and him being the solution to fix it, and he worried that the proposed bill would resolve the problem and deprive him of something to run on. 

Since then, Trump has made immigration and the idea of a border crises the central point of his campaign. He's gone to every border state to rant about it and lambast Democrats for not fixing it. He's brought it up in every appearance, at every interview, at the presidential debate. He's tied the border to false stories about migrants coming over to eat people's pets. He brings it up at every rally. Yet it was he himself who worked to ensure that it wasn't fixed, and now his own party's Senate leader acknowledges it. 

What sort of impact do you think this will have on the election? Will it move voters? Will people see the truth behind the dynamic? Or will his strategy work?",1526,1434,92,"[A reminder for everyone](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/4479er/rules_explanations_and_reminders/).

Trump voters don't care what any politician says except for Trump. And Trump says the border bill was the worst thing ever.

If you are gonna vote based on how hypocritical a political party is....well this won't be the final straw for anyone.",633,2024-11-02 21:44:41,2024-11-02 22:09:56,0.5
