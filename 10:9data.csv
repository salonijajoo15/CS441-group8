What are the economic repercussions is say 35 states adopted this and 15 did not? Let’s say Texas votes against it. Is this another incentive for corporations to move to Texas or is it such a small thing in the corporate scale it’s not worth changing states?",48,2025-10-08 14:31:02,2025-10-08 14:38:06
Politics,hot,"I’m Tom Moore, senior fellow for democracy policy at the Center for American Progress. I’ve figured out a way to break Citizens United. I kid you not. It's a BFD.  AMA.",261,250,11,"(1) How does that work with the internal affairs doctrine?   Let's say that the owners of a Montana corporation that, say, ran a ski resort wanted to run ads to oppose a ballot measure that would impose a high tax on ski resorts.  If the corporation were organized in Delaware, then Delaware's laws are going to govern the powers of the corporation, not Montana's.  

(2) Isn't there a very easy way around this, which corporations were doing long before Citizens United: form an affiliated PAC and have the PAC do the spending.

(3) Are there actually any Montana corporations of note?  Does Montana have a history of its corporations interfering in elections?

(4) Citizen's United is organized as a nonprofit.  Are there some nonprofits (like labor unions) who you think should be able to speak and others who shouldn't?   If so, how does your proposal distinguish between the favored nonprofits and the disfavored nonprofits?",10,2025-10-08 14:31:02,2025-10-08 15:19:00

AMA.",261,250,11,"Good question was asked -- and then deleted -- about unions, and I typed up a full answer! Here it is: 

Q: ""Will unions fight this as well? Citizens United has also been a way for unions to push back against corporate influence in politics.""  
  
A: Some might, yeah. But here’s the thing: this doesn’t single out unions — it applies to *all* artificial entities. For-profit corporations, nonprofits, trade associations, unions, whatever. If you’re created by the state, you only get the powers the state gives you — and that doesn’t have to include political spending.

This cuts both ways for unions. They’ve adapted well to *Citizens United*, but they’re still getting vastly outspent by corporate money. This would disrupt their fundraising, no doubt — but they’d adapt again. What they gain is a far more level playing field.",1,2025-10-08 14:31:02,2025-10-08 15:50:03

It kinda breaks my heart that this solution has been present all along and nobody, not even a Citizens United staunch opposer like Bernie Sanders (etc), platformed it or knew about it?

Have you had any discussions with Democratic progressive leadership about this?

Secondly, Montana is incredibly red at this moment. Is Montana really the best place to test this out? I imagine the Repubs in power would do everything they can, both legal and illegal, to prevent this from being instated even if it was passed by the people on the ballot. What's the plan there?

Me being naive: If I were you, I'd have Bernie platform CPR in Vermont and have it pass and tested there. Idk, thoughts on that?",12,2025-10-08 14:31:02,2025-10-08 14:52:52

Johnson vowed Tuesday to swear-in the congresswoman ""as soon as she wants,"" but he has since flip-flopped, saying she would not be sworn-in until her party agrees to end the government shutdown.

Politics,hot,Photographer Captures Pam Bondi’s Notes—and They’re a Doozy,3776,3738,38,"*Just another episode in the never ending adventure of Cosplaying morons running the Government*

""U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi needed a cheat sheet of attacks to dodge Senator Sheldon Whitehouse’s tough questions.

""While sitting before the Senate Judiciary Committee Tuesday, Bondi [repeatedly refused](https://newrepublic.com/post/201428/pam-bondi-tom-homan-50k-cash-bribe-senate-testimony) to answer questions from the Rhode Island Democrat about what happened to the $50,000 cash bribe border czar Tom Homan received from undercover FBI agents in 2024.""

""Reuters photographer Jonathan Ernst [captured](https://x.com/Mollyploofkins/status/1975725861023457595) an image of the inside of a folder of notes Bondi referred to during questioning by Whitehouse. But her notes had nothing to do with her work as leader of the Department of Justice, or even the embattled border czar. Rather, Bondi had collected screenshots of social media posts, pre-written comebacks, and handwritten notes she hoped could give her a good “gotcha” moment.""

“The questions here are actually pretty specific,” Whitehouse replied, undeterred. “So, having you respond with completely irrelevant far-right internet talking points is really not very helpful here.”

""Below her catalog of clapbacks, Bondi had written a handwritten note “On Epstein” positing whether Whitehouse had ever accepted money from Reid Hoffman, who once invited Epstein to dinner. She used the tidbit to deflect from a question about whether the FBI had seized photos of President Donald Trump with half-naked young women from the safe at Epstein’s estate, as reported by author Michael Wolff.""

“Do you know if the FBI found those photographs in their search of Jeffrey Epstein’s safe or premises or otherwise? Have you seen any such thing?” Whitehouse [asked](https://x.com/atrupar/status/1975569512247235067).""

“You know, Senator Whitehouse, you sit here and make salacious remarks, once again trying to slander President Trump left and right, when you’re the one who was taking money from one of Epstein’s closest confidants, Reid Hoffman,” Bondi replied.""

""Again, Whitehouse continued unbothered. “The question is, did the FBI find those photographs that have been discussed publicly by a witness who claimed Jeffrey Epstein showed them to him. You don’t know anything about that?” he asked, and Bondi fell silent, having exhausted her scant notes.""

""It’s disturbing, but not surprising, that Bondi didn’t make actual preparations to answer tough questions from senators. It appears that the attorney general felt no obligation to be accountable to the American people about alleged efforts to cover up for Trump or his underlings, believing them all to be above the law.""",1,2025-10-08 15:30:37,2025-10-08 15:31:53

I know it's already clear to any reasonable person, but how do you see this and not realize these people are devoid of anything resembling intellectual honesty or principles?

Unfortunately people get their news from social media clips that draw attention. So get a little sensational. Call Bondi a liar to her face. Do something that will make Republicans clutch their pearls circulate a clip for outrage. They’ll  boost attention. I’m sure the broader public won’t mind an f bomb when it’s someone yelling at the AG for covering up a pedophile ring: 

>stop fucking around trying to cover up for pedophiles Ms Bondi. 

>Is the FBI sitting on the evidence or not? Do you even know or have you spent the last 10 months dicking around with your office’s feng shui.

Or how about her nonsense about countless attacks on ICE:

""Then, Miller said: “Under Title 10 of the U.S. Code, the President has plenary authority, has—” before making an abrupt stop. Miller blinked several times, with anchor Boris Sanchez calling out his name, though he still did not respond.""

Politics,hot,Trump aide freezes on live TV after controversial claim about president,14926,14627,299,"This should be the biggest news I America. This wasn't some simple gaffe. Please make sure everyone you know is aware of this. 


Miller claimed trump has ""plenary authority"" which literally translates to unlimited, unchecked power. The power of a king or dictator. 


Then he went dead silent, most likely because the person in his ear was screaming at him to shut up and not say another word. This wasn't one of Miller's many unhinged rants, this was a calm, collected, rehearsed talking point. Just not one that was supposed to be used yet. You can bet that this will be the exact talking point in a few days or weeks when the regime decides to push through some new, previously unthinkable, boundary, likely to do with deploying regular armed forces (not Guardsmen) against US citizens against the express orders of a federal judge.


And CNN is absolutely complicit in help the fascist regime try to hide this. Rather than the interviewer pushing back on this overtly un-American, egregiously anti-Constititional claim of unchecked Executive power, he pretended it was a technical error, then CNN recorded a second take without the 'plenary authority"" claim, and released that one to their YT and other secondary media channels.


The fully fledged totalitarian dictatorship is right around the corner. Miller gave the game away, and the complicit collaborators in Big Media are helping them pull it off.",7741,2025-10-08 05:08:49,2025-10-08 05:24:08

""You can join ICE today and make Jesus smile as you, with a gun, pack foreigners into the back of a van to be kicked out of the country. That is a godly, glorious endeavor.""

>Webbon's co-host Wesley Todd then noted that, as an added bonus, ICE agents ""also get to throw libs to the ground too.""

>""That is also a God-glorifying endeavor,"" Todd said.

Considering Jesus was an immigrant from Egypt into Israel, I'm wondering how Webbon even finds context to say this bullshit.

*America First!!! Really long article, but I think worth if you have the time.*

  
""The right loves the accounts, which often rail against supposed voter fraud. They’re run by a Macedonian who illegally donated to a U.S. House candidate""

""The right-wing information sphere on social media is shaped by large, often anonymous influencer accounts that are then amplified to even wider audiences by prominent conservatives. Two such accounts are Defiant L’s and Resist the Mainstream, both offering takes on American politics, often alleging corruption and election fraud by Democrats, to a combined over 2 million followers. Republican lawmakers like Mike Lee, Nancy Mace, Andy Biggs, Eli Crane, and Dan Crenshaw, along with major political figures like Elon Musk, share the accounts’ posts on X, some claiming [that “illegals” or undocumented immigrants](https://x.com/DefiantLs/status/1908234287180112235) are fraudulently voting in American elections.""

""The owner and operator of both accounts, however, is not only a man who has by his own admission never stepped foot in the United States but has donated over $3,000 in an American election. Donating to American political campaigns as a foreign national is a federal crime, according to [the Federal Election Commission](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/foreign-nationals/).""

""Defiant L’s and Resist the Mainstream are two major players in the right-wing influencer space on X and cover American politics almost exclusively. Defiant L’s in particular enjoys a major reach on the platform thanks to elected officials and Musk, who called Defiant L’s [“one of the best accounts on X”](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1762230030447599714) last year.""

""South Carolina Congresswoman Nancy Mace has [shared multiple posts from the account](https://x.com/NancyMace/status/1914424403997114821), and even replied to Defiant L’s last month, on a post about Congresswoman Ilhan Omar that asked, “What’s the first thought that comes to mind when you see Ilhan Omar?” “Censure,” [Mace replied](https://x.com/RepNancyMace/status/1967770998599823547). Utah Sen. Mike Lee often shares Defiant L’s posts, and in March [tagged](https://x.com/BasedMikeLee/status/1903334433840840818) FBI Director Kash Patel and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino in one reshare. Lee also interacts with Resist the Mainstream, [at least five times this year](https://x.com/search?q=from%3Abasedmikelee%20resistthems%20OR%20defiantls&src=typed_query&f=live) based on a review by *Rolling Sto*ne.""

""A year before obtaining Defiant L’s, Naumovski donated $3,127 in two donations to so-called “QAnon candidate” Ron Watkins’ congressional primary race in Arizona. Naumovski was reported at the time as being Watkins’ largest single donor that quarter — but that was years before it became known that Naumovski wasn’t just of Macedonian origin, but has never had residential status in the U.S., or even been to the U.S., according to his Daily Wire op-ed.""

“Foreign nationals are categorically barred from spending money in our elections, whether it’s directly, via PACs or even SuperPACs,” Saurav Ghosh, director of federal campaign finance reform at the Campaign Legal Center and former counsel at the FEC, tells *Rolling Stone*. Ghosh says that foreign donation schemes often happen via straw donors, or fake names, which are also prohibited, and that a foreign national donating under their own name is rare.""

""A major booster of Naumovski’s career is former Fox News executive Ken LaCorte. LaCorte [admitted](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/technology/LaCorte-edition-news.html) to *The New York Times* in 2019 that he hired Macedonian teenagers from Veles, Naumovski’s Macedonian hometown, to write for several conservative content sites he ran beginning in 2017. Veles is known as the “home to a collection of writers who churned out disinformation during the 2016 presidential election in the United States,” the *Times* reported.""

""The issue of foreign interests influencing American politics through anonymous X influencer accounts is an ongoing one. Last year, federal prosecutors [alleged](https://apnews.com/article/russian-interference-presidential-election-influencers-trump-999435273dd39edf7468c6aa34fad5dd) that the conservative media company Tenet, which pays a network of major right-wing influencers like Benny Johnson and Tim Pool, was secretly being paid by Russian state operatives to disseminate propaganda to a large American audience. Johnson, Pool, and other Tenet content creators [maintain they were unaware](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrlv7jdnq8o) of the alleged Russian influence campaign and were victims of deceptions.""",1,2025-10-08 19:36:09,2025-10-08 19:36:41

Politics,hot,Trump's White House is struggling to pretend it hates the shutdown,606,587,19,"**From Hayes Brown, MSNBC Opinion Writer/Editor:** 



Wednesday dawned to find the federal government shuttered for the eighth straight day with no clear end in sight. Yet again the Senate would fail to find the votes for the continuing resolution House Republicans passed before fleeing Washington last week. The White House is going through the traditional motions of lamenting the lack of agreement on Capitol Hill. But even as the effects of the funding lapse begin to pile up, the Trump administration’s sharpest arguments and strongest efforts to end the shutdown clash heavily with the long-standing goals of the MAGA agenda.



Axios first reported Tuesday that a draft memo from the Office of Management and Budget argues that federal workers furloughed during this shutdown may not receive back pay once funding is restored.



The memo dovetails neatly with a previous threat from OMB Director Russell Vought that the shutdown would be a harbinger of new mass layoffs of federal employees. Congressional Republicans clucked their tongues and shook their heads sanguinely at this latest White House overreach, insisting that they had no power to block Vought from undertaking such an unpleasant task.",1,2025-10-08 17:14:25,2025-10-08 17:14:54

Censored because Im apparently promoting violence according to the warning I got from Reddit. Even though I’m clearly saying to flip the script in a peaceful manner. Its like the heroes wearing Stormtrooper armor in Star Wars. If you’re going to protest please consider doing this, and share with others, if we get enough people to join in I really think the images will make more people come to some sense of reality. Its a small act, but potentially large effect on the narrative. Maybe even co opt MAGA attire at peaceful protests as our own. As a shield against them.

Politics,hot,CNN Anchor Leaves GOP Rep Momentarily Dumbfounded After Exposing Hole In His Story,276,267,9,"From reporter CorEy Townsend:

A recent CNN interview between journalist Kaitlin Collins and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) took an awkward turn when she challenged his explanation for why Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva (D-Ariz.) has not been sworn into Congress.

On Sept. 29, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was accused by Democrats for delaying Grijalva’s swearing-in to stall a vote on the Epstein Files.

When Collins pressed Jordan on the issue, the Ohio Republican stumbled and the conversation spiraled into a heated exchange.

> A decision is not expected to be imminent, one source said, but debate within the administration has shifted recently to more deeply exploring how and when the act might be invoked.

I can't read past the byline because it's astounding that the one time we had actual Insurrection was by his provocation over the 2020 election results.  Yet the fact that this administration (eh, Miller, Vance and Vought) can't realize what would constitute an insurrection and when the act can be invoked, when there's currently no insurrection, seems like they should not be anywhere near any positions of power. 

I mean this entire administration and President is full of people with literally no ethics, no sense of decency, humanity or empathy to the point they can't even understand that their own harassing, bullying, intimidation is why there are laws to protect people in the first place (because of people like them!).   

Like it seems odd that say a man that physically hits his wife, or punches her, that this same person has to figure out when is physical contact abuse and not understanding the question.  ""Is it abuse? I don't know -I punch my wife and that's not abuse...."".   SO it would make sense they don't know how to identify an insurrection.  Not even 1,500 or so convictions caused Trump to think ""hey, maybe they've done a bad illegal thing and broke the law ----- no, they're being persecuted, not prosected and they are hostages, not inmates, so I think I'll pardon them and they can be my red army police people to help attack 10 million people that we'll racially profile"".",1,2025-10-08 19:01:09,2025-10-08 19:12:16

combine that all with global population multiplying by 4 in the last 100 years. crowding. women want fewer children, women want children later. women, at large, no longer accept being dependent on a man, and it's just not practical and it doesn't really provide meaningful security any longer.

The clash between Johnson and Sens. Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego centered on the speaker’s decision not to swear in Democrats’ newest congresswoman-elect until they break the Senate logjam and reopen the government. Full of traded insults and forceful cross talk, the six-minute exchange underscored just how far apart the two parties remain on how to approach reopening the federal government as each side digs in.

The Democratic senators had been speaking with reporters outside the speaker’s office in the US Capitol to argue he was refusing to swear in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva because she’d be the deciding signature to force a House vote related to the Jeffrey Epstein case files.

Politics,hot,JB Pritzker issues defiant response to Donald Trump's jail demand,129,125,4,"By Jenna Sundel and Gabe Whisnant |

Illinois Governor JB Pritzker issued a defiant response on Wednesday after President Donald Trump escalated his criticism of Chicago's Democratic leadership, posting that Mayor Brandon Johnson and Pritzker “should be in jail” for failing to protect federal immigration officers.

The president's remarks came amid intensifying clashes between protesters and ICE agents in Broadview, Illinois, and legal efforts by state officials to block Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago.

Pritzker posted on X, ""I will not back down. Trump is now calling for the arrest of elected representatives checking his power. What else is left on the path to full-blown authoritarianism?""

Politics,hot,JB Pritzker issues defiant response to Donald Trump's jail demand,129,125,4,"
We need to start wearing Trump masks at a peaceful protest. Fight back peacefully, satirically, by flipping his image on him. He’s the one who wants to call for an insurrection and peacefully protesting is an insurrection to him so why not have ICE fire rubber bullets at his visage? Why not have them tackle him (his image) to the ground? Trump is narcissistic and narcissistic people hate the mirror being turned on them so why not have everyone in solidarity wear his image and beg the bootlickers to fire at them and maim their Dear Leader? If they can wear masks to hide their identity, then we can dare them to sh**t at the one giving them their orders. Imagine that look in the media. It would piss him off if he got asked how he felt about ICE attacking his image by an honest journalist in a press conference.

Censored because Im apparently promoting violence according to the warning I got from Reddit. Even though I’m clearly saying to flip the script in a peaceful manner. Its like the heroes wearing Stormtrooper armor in Star Wars. If you’re going to protest please consider doing this, and share with others, if we get enough people to join in I really think the images will make more people come to some sense of reality. Its a small act, but potentially large effect on the narrative. Maybe even co opt MAGA attire at peaceful protests as our own. As a shield against them. Would ICE fire at “MAGATS?”  “It hurt itself in its confusion.” I’d like to see them spin that on Fox News.",1,2025-10-08 21:05:58,2025-10-08 22:03:30

Politics,hot,Schiff Lists Every Question Pam Bondi Ignored as She Melts Down,34955,33906,1049,"From the transcript:

Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA) to Pam Bondi: 

I think it's valuable that the American people get a sense of what you have refused to answer today. So, these are just some of the questions you refuse to answer, but or have answered with personal attacks on members of this committee. 

* You were asked whether you consulted with career ethics lawyers, as you promised you would do during your nomination hearing, when you approved the president receiving a $400 million gift from the Qataris, you refused to answer that question. 

* You were asked who or what role you may have played, or who played the role in asking that Trump's name be flagged in any of the Epstein documents gathered by the FBI? You refused to answer that
 question. 

* You were asked whether Homan kept the $50,000 bribe money. You
 refused to answer that question. 

* You were asked whether Homan paid taxes on the
 $50,000 bribe money. You refused to answer that question. 

* You were asked, did career prosecutors find insufficient evidence to charge James Comey. You refused to
 answer that question. 

* You were asked, how are military strikes on these boats in
 the Caribbean legal. And you refused to even answer that question. 

* You are asked, excuse me, excuse me? You are asked, did you discuss indicting James Comey with
 the president. You refused to answer that question. 

* You were asked, did you
 approve of the firing of antitrust lawyers who disagreed with the Hewlett Packard
 merger. You refused to answer that question. 

* You were asked whether you support
 a restoration fund for violent insurrections, insurrections to attack the Capitol on
 January 6th. You refused to answer that question. 

* You were asked whether you were
 firing career professionals, career prosecutors just because they worked on January
 6th. Question January 6th investigations. You refused to answer that question. 

* You were asked by my colleague whether you believe government officials, like
 immigration officials, have to abide by court orders. You wouldn't answer that
 question.",3324,2025-10-07 19:28:17,2025-10-07 21:12:16

and then pick fights. Be aggressive and on the offensive. It's infuriating that ""they're weird"" was dropped when it actually made Republicans react to us for once. Talk about how Republicans want us all to be busy bodies, when they say they care about children, dismiss it by pointing out that they wont address the biggest threat to children in this country: guns.

Politics,top,Billionaires at Trump's Swearing-In Have Since Lost $210 Billion,70046,65843,4203,"*More from Bloomberg News reporter Dylan Sloan:*

As Donald Trump took the oath of office on Jan. 20, he was flanked by some of the world’s wealthiest people. The billionaires present that day — including Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg — had never been richer, flush with big gains from frothy stock markets.

Seven weeks later, it’s a different story. The start of Trump’s second term has delivered a stunning reversal for many of those billionaires sitting behind Trump in the Capitol Rotunda, with five having lost a combined $210 billion in wealth, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Janet Mills and Trump at the White House in February. When Trump demanded she comply with his executive order banning [transgender](https://www.advocate.com/transgender?utm_campaign=SmartLinks) athletes from girls’ and women’s sports or lose all federal funding, [Mills didn’t flinch](https://www.advocate.com/politics/maine-governor-trump-trans-sports).

>The victory for Maine is also a win for basic decency and due process. Trump’s USDA had frozen more than $3 million in funding for programs that feed over 170,000 children and vulnerable adults in the state, claiming Maine’s inclusive sports policy violated Title IX. But a federal judge ruled last month that the agency had likely failed to follow required legal procedures. Rather than risk a broader injunction, the USDA folded.

Janet Mills, you are amazing! I am so glad to see someone stand up for trans kids and stand up to bullies like Trump and the Christian nationalists. 

  
The rest of the Democratic Party needs to take notes from Mills and Pritzker. Instead of genuflecting to Trump and the Christian nationalists, we don't appease fascists.",4939,2025-05-05 22:08:46,2025-05-05 22:12:06

This won't break the MAGA movement, most of them don't even see a problem that most of the people sent to CECOT don't have criminal records and were sent without due process. Don't expect a moral compass from people who think standing on American soil undocumented is a crime worthy of life in prison, at best, and at worst being torn apart in cells with dozens of criminals.

 “Trump’s exchange with Moran, however, made it seem like Trump believed the letters and numbers were part of the original tattoo. 

“That was Photoshopped? Terry you can’t do that,” Trump told Moran. 



“Hey, they’re giving you the big break of a lifetime,” he continued. “You’re doing the interview. I picked you because—frankly I never heard of you but that’s OK. I picked you but you’re not being very nice. He had ‘MS-13’ tattooed—”



“We’ll agree to disagree. I want to move on to something else,” Moran said. 



“Terry. Terry. Do you want me to show you the picture?” Trump said.”



More from the article:

“He doesn’t have a criminal record, and no court has found him to be a member of a gang. Instead, Trump officials have offered up tenuous evidence of Abrego Garcia’s MS-13 “membership,” including the tattoos. 



“No, no. Terry. Terry,” Trump insisted. “No, no. No, no. He had ‘M-S’ as clear as you can be, not ‘interpreted.’ This is why people no longer believe the news, because—”

And more from the article:



“At that point Moran—who had responded to Trump’s earlier digs with a smile—sighed the kind of deep sigh that parents of toddlers know well. 



He pointed out that the word “MS-13” doesn’t appear in any of the photos of Abrego Garcia that have been taken since he was deported to El Salvador. 

“Terry!” Trump interjected. 



“Ukraine, sir,” Moran practically begged. 



“He’s got ‘MS-13’ on his knuckles, okay?” Trump said. “You’re just such a disservice. Why don’t you just say, ‘Yes he does’ and go on to something else?”



“It’s contested,” Moran replied. “Ukraine.”",4643,2025-04-30 11:31:33,2025-04-30 12:05:14

> U.S. courts lack jurisdiction to order his return from the megaprison where he’s now locked up.

No, this can't be brushed off as a mere mistake or ""error"" because for one, it can be better described as a tragic fucking failure and human rights violation, and two, It's not a mistake when plenty of others like this man are being deliberately targeted in the same manner

You sent an innocent person to one of the most dangerous prisons in the world, and he's not the only one.

This is what happens when you ignore judges, wipe your ass with the constitution, and assert your unilateral executive authority over other branches of government.

This is part of a growing *pattern* of cruel and unlawful actions committed by the Trump administration.

The ethical, legal and moral implications are not even dubious at best.

We're talking about mass deportation raids rounding up and arresting thousands of supposed immigrants, some of whom include veterans, U.S. citizens and hardworking, taxpaying individuals.

Yes, there are even cases where citizens are being arrested and detained, Including one such incident involving a ten year old with brain cancer.

While this incident with the Maryland man is not isolated either. The Trump administration is knowingly targeting immigrants who are in the U.S. *legally.*

They're violating civil rights, ignoring due process, destabilizing communities, harming local economies, spending tens of millions on shipping immigrants in and out of Guantanamo bay, including people with no criminal records. Don't forget how some of these same facilities were once used to harbor members of Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups 

While many of these detention centers—even in the US—are lacking in things like basic amenities.

And whether you want to believe it or not, under the U.S. constitution, even immigrants in the U.S. are afforded due process. How the hell else are you going to prove that these people are the criminals you make them out to be?

And of course there's Trump's new partnership with a ruthless dictator in El Salvador, where immigrants who are often wrongfully detained or misidentified are being sent away be locked up inside of one of the most treacherous and violent places on earth without that assurance of due process.

And despite this, when U.S. judges push back against these unconstitutional measures, Trump responds by asserting his unitary executive powers while him and his supporters attack all critics and label them as terrorist or gang sympathizers.

Which calls our attention to the whole ""Venezuelan gang members"" fiasco.

ICE agents, whether deliberately or not, are misidentifying tattoos as gang related, even looking for certain clothing to single out so-called gang members and immigrants.

Here are just a few examples.

- Immigration officials have tried to identify people wearing Chicago Bulls jerseys as immigrants or gang members. Some have been detained and face deportation despite any confirmation that they are, in fact, gang members.

- Venezuelan immigrants deported to El Salvador were given no due process. And even though they were deemed criminals and gang members from the onset without the chance to prove otherwise, the government has used non-gang affiliated tattoos as evidence for their detainment and deportation.

- An actual tattoo *artist* from Venezuela, who entered the U.S. legally mind you, was deported because his tattoos were misidentified. 

- A *teenager* from Dallas was deported after immigration officials labeled his tattoo as gang related, even though he is not associated with a gang, and neither was his tattoo. He only elected to get the tattoo because he thought it ""looked cool.""

- An LGBTQ asylum seeker was also detained and deported because immigration officials misidentified his tattoos as gang related. The tattoos had no gang affiliations.

- The ACLU obtained a list from ICE of tattoos and clothing that immigration officers have been using to falsely identify gang members. The list includes tattoos that are *not* gang related, but were still used as grounds for deportation.

- Friends, family and even legal representatives have provided sworn declarations that state how many of these targeted and deported individuals have no ties to gangs and have been falsely identified based on their tattoos.

There are also many more examples of The Trump administration detaining or deporting immigrants who are in the U.S *legally*. So much for only going after the ""criminals.""

These cases include—but are not limited to—visa holders, green card holders, immigrants married to U.S. citizens, immigrants who have lived in the U.S for decades and foreign students.

And yes, there are several cases where U.S. citizens have been wrongfully detained under the Trump administration. Some cases include native Americans, one case even involved a Trump supporter, and another included that ten year old girl with brain cancer who was detained and eventually deported with her undocumented family members despite her citizenship.

For a lot of these people, the trauma doesn't stop and end with their detainment or deportation.

Many of them are deported to dangerous conditions, violent prisons, or unstable countries with high rates of crime and violence. Many are separated from their families, some have even lost their legal status, their rights, their access to the asylum seeking process, and/or their access to all other avenues for staying in the U.S. 

Not to mention that while these people are detained, they're often held in detention centers that lack basic medical care, legal support and amenities...

And on top of all of this, those wrongfully identified as gang members face discrimination and stigma, and perhaps for the rest of their lives.

So yah, ""mistake"" doesn't even begin to describe what's happening. Even if you don't sympathize with these people for whatever reason, you can at least acknowledge the exorbitant cost of this operation, the logistical nightmare it's come to be, and the damage it's doing to communities and the national economy.

Don't forget that immigrants add trillions of dollars to our GDP and work in sectors that are crucial to a functioning economy. Labor shortages in these sectors will lead to harmful consequences for the economy, which will only be exacerbated by Trump's disastrous trade and tariff policies.",3054,2025-04-01 04:41:10,2025-04-01 04:48:34

Politics,top,Newsom blasts ‘spineless’ ABC for pulling Jimmy Kimmel over Charlie Kirk remarks,56789,52813,3976,"Compendium of notable Charlie Kirk statements:

* At a Turning Point USA event in 2023, Kirk argued, “We must also be real. We must be honest with the population. Having an armed citizenry comes with a price, and that is part of liberty... But I think it’s worth it. I think it’s worth to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year, so that we can have the Second Amendment.”
* On his radio show, Kirk dismissed empathy as a harmful idea. “I can’t stand the word empathy, actually. I think empathy is a made-up, new age term that does a lot of damage.”
* During a heated exchange on Jubilee’s Surrounded, he claimed Black people were “better” in the 1940s. “They were actually better in the 1940s. It was bad. It was evil. But what happened? Something changed. They committed less crimes… Black America is worse than it has been in the last 80 years.”
* On child pregnancy after rape? When asked how he would advise his daughter in a disturbing scenario, he said, “The answer is yes. The baby would be delivered.”
* At a TPUSA event, he compared trans identity to blackface. “A man who calls himself trans is wearing ‘woman face,’ no different than I would wear Black face trying to be a Black person. It’s assuming an identity that isn’t yours.”
* On his radio show, he claimed Joy Reid, Michelle Obama, Sheila Jackson Lee, and Ketanji Brown Jackson were “affirmative action picks” and went further, “Black women do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously. You had to go steal a white person’s slot to go be taken somewhat seriously.”
* After Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s engagement, he fantasized about her becoming more conservative. “Submit to your husband, Taylor. You’re not in charge.”
* On X, once commented, “Gun control, like vaccines and masks, is focused on making people feel ‘safe’ by taking freedoms away from others. Don’t fall for it.”
* Kirk often railed against retirement. “For future retirees, people under the age of 45, we should absolutely raise the retirement age. I’m not a fan of retirement. I don’t think retirement is biblical… I think, what a waste of the gifts that God has given you.”",1462,2025-09-18 01:24:41,2025-09-18 01:40:11

The line seems to be when there's threats behind it. There's an argument that anything coming from the government carriess a level of implied threat, which signs reasonable, but if that were the case then the governed wouldn't have a 1A right.

Politics,controversial,The Right Wants to Exterminate Trans People. Liberals Are Helping.,8,4,4,">It’s not that centrists have been engaging in the same Nazi-style rhetoric as conservatives. But the anti-trans hysteria that has swept through the United States over the past few years would never have found so much purchase without the participation of elite liberal political and media institutions. The New York Times and The Atlantic have published story after story about the supposed dangers of gender-affirming care, particularly for minors, and stoked fears about trans people’s participation in sports. These scaremongering campaigns may come dressed in more respectable clothing than a Fox News rant, but they are similarly grounded in myth.

…

>Transphobes exploited this coverage—after all, if “even the liberal New York Times” was concerned, there must be something going on, right? Times coverage has been used by a wide range of politicians, lawyers, and courts to justify anti-trans policies; Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas cited the paper seven times in his opinion in US vs. Skrmetti, one of the most significant attacks on trans rights in recent memory.

…

>These days, it seems that not a week goes by without some prominent Democrat bashing trans people—despite the Trump administration’s placing a bigger and bigger target on their backs. California Governor Gavin Newsom, seen as a leading potential contender in the 2028 presidential election, infamously declared in a podcast with Kirk that it was “deeply unfair” for trans women and girls to compete with cis women and girls in sports. Former Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, whose name is also in the 2028 mix, rejected the idea of trans identity completely in a conversation with Megyn Kelly, saying, “Can a man become a woman? Uh, no.”",26,2025-09-25 12:46:13,2025-09-25 12:59:05

Politics,controversial,Bernie Agrees: Democratic Party Is a ‘Threat to Democracy’,0,0,0,"As a leftist who also previously worked in progressive politics, I agree. Trump did not win in 2016, Democrats lost. There's a difference. 38% of people who previously voted for Obama switched to Trump in 2016. Demographically, most Americans are policy-wise to the left of your average Democratic politician and if the Democrats are not going to fix any of our problems (and it's bleak out there) then people are not going to come out to vote and Republicans will win. We can't just continue to vote to hold back apocalypse without building anything and now many young people are like 'yeah, burn it all down bc my life trajectory is bleak with the way things are going' that doesn't mean that they're right and things can't get even bleaker which they are but Bernie was a moment in which we could have turned everything around, started heading towards Star Trek and not Mad Max and the Democratic establishment used everything in their power to stop that.

Polling is not an arcane art, we have real numbers that tell us what most people actually believe and the Democratic establishment thought the risk was worth it to not moving policy-wise leftwards.",6,2025-05-20 03:19:33,2025-05-20 18:43:10

Politics,controversial,Bernie Agrees: Democratic Party Is a ‘Threat to Democracy’,0,0,0,"**Bernie Agrees: Democratic Party Is a ‘Threat to Democracy’
Bernie Sanders has some harsh words for the party he once hoped to lead.**

*In a May 19 appearance on the Flagrant podcast, Sanders joined hosts Andrew Schulz and Akaash Singh in a rant about the Democratic Party’s handling of the 2024 presidential election, at one point agreeing with Singh that the party has become “a threat to democracy.”*

*The episode opened with Schulz introducing Sanders as having been “mocked, sidelined, and betrayed—and that’s just by his own party,” earning a laugh from the senator.*

*For the next 90 minutes, Sanders, 83, joined the hosts in a frank breakdown of his issues with the Democratic Party.*

*Schulz, who described himself as a “lifelong Democrat,” complained that establishment Democrats seemed incapable of connecting with young and working-class voters. Sanders echoed his woes, venting that even after losing the 2024 election, his colleagues still “won’t listen” to him about how to appeal to voters.*

*While Sanders credited the Biden administration for being open to discussion and “understanding that [Sanders] represented millions of people,” he said that willingness has gone away since the former president left office.*

*“You’ve got a Democratic establishment which is funded by wealthy people,” said Sanders. “You have consultants who are really way out of touch with reality who make a whole lot of money in campaigns, and the working class is ignored.”*

*The senator blamed Kamala Harris’ loss on these same consultants, saying he “begged” her team not to move forward with messaging that implied her presidency would be a redux of Joe Biden’s. However, the senator agreed with Schulz and Singh that Democrats had generally mishandled the 2024 election.*

*“Democrats, we felt that we didn’t have a say on who could be president,” lamented Schulz. “We talk a lot about the Republicans being autocrats and oligarchs and taking over democracy. But from the Democrat perspective—and I’m a lifelong Democrat—I felt like the Democratic Party completely removed the democratic process from its constituents. And I think they need to have some accountability [for] that.”*

*“No argument here,” Sanders replied.*

*However, Sanders did strongly disagree with one of his host’s points when Schulz expressed disappointment that, despite being sidelined by the establishment, Sanders continued to back Democratic nominees like Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Kamala Harris in 2024.*

*“[Trump] won anyway, so why not just burn it all down?” asked Schulz.*

*“Because it’s easy to say,” said Sanders. “But ‘burning it down’ means children will not have food to eat. The schools will deteriorate. People will not have healthcare. I’m an elected official. I’ve got to represent the people. I can’t turn my back on them.”*

*Singh interjected with another question: “But could we not also say, if there hasn’t been a fair primary for the Democrats since 2008, are they not also a threat to democracy?”*

*“Fair enough,” Sanders answered. “I’m not gonna argue with that.”*",18,2025-05-20 03:19:33,2025-05-20 03:20:51

Politics,controversial,Colombia backs down in migrant row with Trump after president threatens tariffs,19,10,9,"***The Telegraph reports:***

Colombia has backed down in a row over migrants with Donald Trump after the US president threatened to hit the South American country with punitive tariffs.

On Sunday Mr Trump said he would impose the measures on Colombia in an angry response to the South American country blocking [migrant deportation flights](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2025/01/24/hundreds-illegal-immigrants-already-arrested-deported-trump/).

Mr Trump warned the measures, including immediate 25 per cent taxes on Colombian goods among a broad range of sanctions, were “only just the beginning”.

He said tariffs would increase to 50 per cent after one week.

A few hours later, the White House announced it was shelving the tariffs plan after Colombia agreed to accept deported migrants, but other penalties would remain in place.

Colombia has agreed to “unrestricted acceptance of all illegal aliens from Colombia returned from the United States, including on US military aircraft, without limitation or delay,” a White House statement said.

“Today’s events make clear to the world that America is respected again,” it added.

“President Trump will continue to fiercely protect our nation’s sovereignty, and he expects all other nations of the world to fully cooperate in accepting the deportation of their citizens illegally present in the United States.”

Colombia’s foreign minister confirmed it had “overcome the impasse” with Washington and added that it would “continue receiving Colombians who return as deportees”.

Politics,controversial,Election guru Nate Silver reveals AOC is Democrat most likely to lead 2028 presidential ticket,0,0,0,"She'd be a fool to run for president in 28, though this chatter is nothing but good for a more achievable goal: the senate. Schumer is old, out of touch and unpopular with younger voters. Beyond being the title of my sex tape, that is bad news for his reelection chances and his seat is up in 2028.

Should he retire, AOC is in a great position to win the primary and then the general. If he doesn't retire, she would likely win a primary given she is a lot more popular than Schumer, though it could turn off some centrist dems.

If that were to happen, a strong, moderate republican could have a better chance than if Schumer retired. Had Stefanik not gone full MAGA, she would have been able to peel moderates from AOC after a primary win against Schumer.

AOC is young. A seat in the senate will strengthen her reach and give her better experience than with the hoi polloi in the house. Should a dem win in 28, she can support the administration in the senate, serve her full term and run in 36.

She would be in her mid 40s then with almost a decade in the Senate added to her already strong advocacy in the house. Even if she lost the primary then, she'd still have her senate seat as 36 will be two years into her second term.",9,2025-04-17 23:28:26,2025-04-17 23:47:52

Politics,controversial,Does the Democratic Party Have a Death Wish?,0,0,0,"Every thing he said was true, but his solution is a non starter. Third parties don't work. I say that as a 2000s era Naderite. You have to defeat these people using the Democratic Primary system. Does that seem like mission impossible? Yes, but it is easier than trying to form a new party. All you need are enough voters in a district to show up to the primary. That's much easier than trying to get multiples of that number to vote for a 3rd party candidate in the general. The corporate Dems controlling the party are insufferable; the fact that they've lost to Trump twice says it all really. You have to take them out in primaries though.

There's actually a template for this: Republicans. Today's Republicans are not the same people that controlled the party 20 years ago. Those guys were pretty bad, but they are nothing like what is in office now. That was accomplished by years of primary challenges and finally Trump in the White House. The old establishment had to either get with the new program or leave.

Politics,controversial,Kamala Harris Accuses Biden’s Team of Sabotaging Her,6,3,3,"I know she needs to sell a book and everything, so I see what she's doing here.  Bottom line, whoever got Joe to run again is to blame, there SHOULD have been a primary, and that was what doomed the election.



Look, let's be brutally honest about 2024, otherwise we're doomed to repeat it.  Kamala was a bad candidate.  Had there been a primary, she would have exposed how bad of a candidate she was and someone else would have been nominated, she NEVER would have been the candidate unless they did another anointment like they did with Hillary - which is essentially what happened.  Kamala was NEVER going to win the general because she was such a bad candidate.  Joe running again was a HORRIBLE idea from the start, so blame Jill Biden or whoever decided to made that happen.  However, once that die was cast, the Dem apparatus was stuck with only 2 possible options to recover from the shitshow Biden debate, and that was it.

The options were to rehabilitate Biden's image after that shitshow of a debate, which they actually attempted for a full MONTH, and was doomed to failure as it was an impossible task from the level of decline he was displaying - or anoint the VP as the candidate.  There wasn't time for any realistic primary once Joe dropped out with around 3 months until the election.  Doing anything other than those 2 options would have exposed how weak Biden/Harris had become, and would require undoing all of their messaging and everything 3ish months before the election.  



There just wasn't time to do anything other than what they tried under the circumstances.  However, I hope they have fully realized that trying to anoint candidates that have no charisma, and are very much disliked figures by a good percentage of voters is now shown and confirmed to be what NOT to do from the 2 times they did this and lost to the conman currently sitting in the Oval.",11,2025-09-10 17:27:32,2025-09-10 17:51:05

Quotes from the book mentioned in article 

> When Fox News attacked me on everything from my laugh, to my tone of voice, to whom I’d dated in my 20s, or claimed I was a “DEI hire,” the White House rarely pushed back with my actual résumé: two terms elected D.A., top cop in the second-largest department of justice in the United States, senator representing one in eight Americans….

> They had a huge comms team; they had Karine Jean-Pierre briefing in the pressroom every day. But getting anything positive said about my work or any defense against untrue attacks was almost impossible.

> Joe was already polling badly on the age issue, with roughly 75 percent of voters saying he was too old to be an effective president. Then he started taking on water for his perceived blank check to Benjamin Netanyahu in Gaza.

> When polls indicated that I was getting more popular, the people around him didn’t like the contrast that was emerging….

> Their thinking was zero-sum: If she’s shining, he’s dimmed. None of them grasped that if I did well, he did well. That given the concerns about his age, my visible success as his vice president was vital. It would serve as a testament to his judgment in choosing me and reassurance that if something happened, the country was in good hands. My success was important for him.

> His team didn’t get it.",13,2025-09-10 17:27:32,2025-09-10 17:29:38

It's a question of whether you -can- meet food needs, in an emergency. If there's a war, are you going to have enough grains, and a varied enough diet, to provide an adequate ration to everyone? Do you need to import food, and if so, will those imports be available? What if your war with one country suddenly turns into war with two or three others?

Get this wrong and you get things like the Bengal Famine.

Basically, this isn't an issue for the US at all; we export huge quantities of food, and there's absolutely nobody who is in a better position to protect their ability to import as well. So from a national security perspective, it's not a particular issue for the US; we're well-provisioned and there's nothing short of nuclear exchange that would affect our ability to get enough to eat.

Limb soreness was not a side effect of the illness.

Make it so that the house of representatives expands, so that the population of the last populous state is the baseline for one representative, and every state gets representation based on that, rounding percentages normally. 

So, Wyoming has about 580,000 people living there, so they get one rep. California has about 40 million people, so 40,000,000/580,000=68.96, so California gets 69 representatives, instead of the 52 they currently have. That makes the house more representative of the population, while leaving the Senate to represent the states. It would also make presidential elections more representative of the population without entirely removing the importance of individual states.

Because while it is (effectively) universally agreed that the U.S. electoral system is a horrific mess, NO ONE can come up with a majority, much less a large majority, on how to figure out how to fix (whether by statute or constitutional amendment) that does not violate one of the following

  
1) The proposed solution is unicorn-rainbow-fantasyland. ""Let's get rid of the electoral college"" is this: it would require the very states that benefit from it to vote to give up their own disproportionate power.

2) The proposed solution violates the First Amendment. Sorry, gang, scream and cry all you want, but ""Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech...the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances."" Any of your ""ban lobbying"" attempts are simply not going to get past this (or trying to play some game where ""good"" lobbying and ""good"" speech is still allowed, but the ""bad guys"" cannot speak is either unconstitutional or unicorn-rainbow-fantasyland.

So yes, the system is horrible. But it is horrible because no one has, or arguably CAN, come up with a solution that

If you take the UK for example, if you lump the parties into ""Conservative"" and ""progressive"" and the country into ""north"" and ""south"" you get quite a neat picture like you describe. However it's fundamentally flawed.

It lends itself to looking at a geographic map and going ""hey look the bottom half is blue and the top half is red"". Or even in the case of England ""wow the entire of England is blue!"". It misrepresented where actual representatives are though.

For example, here is a geographic map of the UK general election results from 2010, in this election no party won more than half the seats in parliament:

https://www.libdemvoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/UK-Political-Map1-1.jpg

Just looking at that map, you'd think 66%+ of MPs were conservative.

This, on the other hand, is a map of the exact same results, but made based on constituency location not geography:

https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ9guGvhLOuMlKTy15pu6c6zDyopg59vaacwLU5kiq0eg&s=10

In this one the big diamond shape down the bottom is all the constituencies in London, which is mostly red. Since each of those hexagons represents roughly 60,000 people, it presents a much more balanced view because counting London as ""one place in the south"" when 10m out of 70m people live there but counting the south east as an entire region, which has slightly less people in it, is a bit mad.

Next there is the idea that the north is progressive and the south is conservative specifically. This analysis of voting patterns in the UK is, I'm sorry to say, about 15 years out of date, and I say that because I studied politics as a degree over 15 years ago and loads of stuff written about UK politics back then should have been thrown out by now.

Partisan politics always reflects the cleavages you have in society. In the UK, like most western democracies, those cleavages were traditionally economic, not social. The left wing parties were about taxing people and spending the money on the wider public, and the right wing parties were about not doing that. Obviously social conservatism is therefore a feature of parties that support the rich, because they got rich in the world exactly like it is, but the voting lines were primarily economic.

So what you have as a split is the North voting for economic policies that benefit the poor, and the South voting for economic policies that benefit the rich. This makes sense because the South is wealthier than the north.

However, now social progress/conservatism is a key cleavage, those voting patterns have shifted significantly. The next time one of these naps are done, what you're going to see is a lot of the north of England voting Reform, which is the hard right wing party here, and the only places that stay red will be the cities. The rich countryside will stay blue, largely, but big chunks of the south will go to reform too.

This clearly disproved the hypothesis that Northern regions are inherently more ""progressive"". There is no inherent progressive nature to Northern people, they are driven by whatever splits in society effect everyone.

So why was there historically that split? Economics, the north is poorer than the south. Poorer people tend to support change and public spending, rich people tend to support the status quo and low taxes. Scotland and Wales are sort of exceptions, because they were historically quite brutally pressed by the English and were left very poor by the English governments. This means even when the economic element is less important there's a cultural difference. 

You cite Italy as an example, but from my understanding of Italian politics they see something similar to the UK, where the cities tend to vote left, and the wealth countryside areas of the country vote right. The left wing parties are therefore most successful in Central Italy where the cities are, not the South. 

Finally, there is the question, what even is north or south in a country? It's a rarely based on geography or population. The end result is there's a line which rather splits the nation in two based on another already established split. I won't explain this when there's an excellent map men video that addresses it:

https://youtu.be/ENeCYwms-Cc?si=xmfPV3D8EZvN3--h

So in short there's no evidence that Northern regions of countries are just more progressive. There are splits, but often it's because we, as humans, have decided to draw a divide in the country between north and south at an point representing some other factor (e.g. Wealth) rather than based on anything empirical, and then ignore the bits that don't fit (e.g. London being very much the south sand voting left wing).",16,2025-10-07 02:55:08,2025-10-07 08:40:16

It feels like a lot of wars criss cross most of the criteria there. The Allied Forces did most of those things. The French entertained similar such conditions for Algerians.

PoliticalDiscussion,hot,What are your thoughts on the UN OSAPG framework and how it applies to various situations around the world?,1,0,1,">What are your thoughts?

I agree that the items listed here and the overall framework of what constitutes genocide are mostly valid.  

The bottom line of genocide is that it's a willful attempt to wipe out an entire nation and national culture.  It's considered worse than murder, since it doesn't just entail killing the physical body, but also any memory of who the people were and that they even existed at all.  

American generals say things like ""Bomb them back to the Stone Age.""  Condemning a country to live under Stone Age conditions would be tantamount to a death sentence, so even that could be seen as a possible intent to commit genocide.  

As far as making any kind of legal case, the prospect of someone actually arresting a world leader and charging them with crimes against humanity seems exceedingly remote.  In practice, the charge of genocide seems more an appeal to world opinion which carries no official or legal weight.  But it does carry some political weight - even if the U.S. veto power in the U.N. can override that.  

I think they got worked up by war fever, consumed by blind rage - similar to what possessed Americans just after 9/11.  It seems like some kind of ""temporary insanity"" which eventually goes away.",1,2025-10-07 23:43:04,2025-10-08 14:11:21

PoliticalDiscussion,hot,"""Should world leaders be required to have a political party affiliation, or is it better for them to remain independent?",0,0,0,"You... don't really have an option here. They're not leaders because they meet your criteria, they're leaders of the respective countries that they represent. If they are part of a party (and virtually all of them will be) then you don't get to say ""well, you're not a real leader because I think you should be an independent instead"".

That said, keep in mind that parliaments form the majority of democratic governments and the leader of a parliamentary system is virtually always going to be a member of a party in that parliament, just by virtue of how those systems work. They're the leader -because- their party either has a majority or can form a coalition willing to work with that leader. It would be very weird for a parliamentary government to be led by someone not a member of the largest party of that coalition - not impossible, but I can't think of any examples offhand.

Bit more doable with the US presidential system, but in practice, being part of one of the two parties gives you access to a lot of motivated people who can fill leadership roles and marshal the government to actually carry out your initiatives; Trump's difficulty with this is illustrative of what happens when the leader yanks on the levers of power and the levels below them don't carry out the policy.",1,2025-10-07 15:26:25,2025-10-08 13:56:41

What I would really like to see is a mandatory screening process that identifies sociopaths, and a law that prohibits them from holding political office on the grounds of public safety.

We don't allow blind people to claim discrimination when the state refuse to grant a license to drive anything, so why should we allow people who are positively known to lie, manipulate, and harm others for personal pleasure and power to run for and hold political office? Who can be trusted to pervert and corrupt whatever they have access to? Today, we have the tools to positively identify sociopaths based on brain patterns, so it isn't a matter of opinion as to whether they are or aren't sociopaths incapable of feeling empathy, love, remorse, guilt or any of the other social emotions that make living together peacefully possible.

PoliticalDiscussion,hot,Will U.S. presidents have trouble getting reelected going forward due to distrust of incumbents?,0,0,0,"I don't think it is that black and white. I think we were in a unique situation because of COVID bleeding into inflation, so things have been considered bad for a long time. And I can remember even pre-COVID I heard many people talking about delaying major purchases because it felt like a recession was coming. When it feels like things have been bad for as long as you can remember, voters want change. 

While I'm not giving Biden a pass on any responsibility for inflation, he was simply incapable of defending his own record. There was a decent story to tell for a skilled speaker (soft landing, compare U.S. to other 1st world countries, etc.), but that person wasn't Biden. If an incumbent wants another chance when things are bad, they need to convince us exactly why they deserve it. Biden (and later Kamala) basically said 'I'm gonna give you 4 more years of the same'. That's the opposite of what voters wanted to hear.

Bob Casey (D-PA) was another good example of an incumbent being pushed out. He had very little to say while campaigning that wasn't 'I support Biden' and 'look at my past record'. That's not what voters want to hear when things are bad and have been bad for a long time. I think that is especially true in a purple state like PA. You can't count on a majority who are going to vote blue or red regardless. Though out-of-state millionaire Dave McCormick was such a bad candidate that I still thought Casey would narrowly win, like how recent stroke victim Fetterman previously beat Dr. Oz. But Casey also got zero help from the top of the ticket.

But when things are going good, I don't see why a future incumbent wouldn't still be re-elected, even if they didn't directly contribute to the good times. Sometimes it's the luck of the draw. You could be a terrible candidate, but running when your party holds the White House and a majority in Congress during a good time for the country.

At most a left wing male might be seen as a bit non-masculine or perhaps overly preachy and annoying, but with the right personal temperament and presentation that can be avoided.

The prominent Democrats, except for Newsom, certainly seem to think so. I wish they'd share whatever inside knowledge they have.


If Republicans succeed in gerrymandering 8 seats to the Democrats' 5, and the generic house ballot holds at D+3, and we account for no Trump On The Ballot Effect in the off-cycle, I think the Dems come out in control, 2-3 seats ahead. 




This by itself means little though - Trump's executive is lawless, and the Republican Senate (which is not going to flip. Dems net two seats at most) shows no interest in asserting itself. It would take impeachment and conviction to stop the rescissions, quasi-recess-appointments, and arbitrary defunding. Right now it's only the courts that are preventing the genesis of martial law.

PoliticalDiscussion,hot,What tangible benefits justify the multi-million-dollar cost of in-person summits between national leaders?,7,4,3,"It's useful for overcoming internal opposition and bureaucratic inertia.

If the leader says ""why don't we do X"" under normal circumstances, people within that administration who are opposed to doing X can say something like ""we need to examine the issues around doing X"" or ""let's conduct an inquiry into doing X"", and then proceed to kick the can down the road by months or years. ""We're still working on that inquiry!""

At a summit, you have a lot of time pressure and ""let's wait"" doesn't work. You have to marshal the actual arguments against doing X, and discuss them presumably with other elements of the administration whose position is ""X is a great idea, and here's why"". If you don't have that discussion -right now-, then the decision gets made and X becomes policy - and, because it's something that was also discussed and agreed to with other nations, it's a difficult policy to overturn.

Of course this is one reason that you carefully limit the topics of the summit in advance, so that everyone has done the appropriate preparation and made sure that their position is represented among the staff that's actually at the summit. And, not to put too fine a point on it, the other nation(s) present have an opinion too, so sometimes nothing is going to be accomplished because there's just not an agreeable position on the topic between the countries involved.",1,2025-10-03 16:39:32,2025-10-04 18:04:10
PoliticalDiscussion,hot,What tangible benefits justify the multi-million-dollar cost of in-person summits between national leaders?,7,4,3,"It’s a fair question — on paper, flying dozens of world leaders and staff around the globe seems outdated when encrypted video calls exist. But in-person summits still offer something hard to replicate: *trust and informal negotiation*.

Most real progress happens not in the televised sessions but in the private side meetings — the hallway chats, one-on-ones, and spontaneous coalitions that form over dinner. Those interactions build personal rapport that makes later compromises possible.

There’s also symbolism. Showing up physically signals commitment and unity — especially in crises. During the Cold War, Kennedy’s and Khrushchev’s meetings, or even the Reagan-Gorbachev summits, changed tone and policy direction simply because they humanized the other side.

Studies in diplomacy and negotiation back this up: face-to-face settings increase empathy, reduce miscommunication, and make agreements more durable. It’s expensive, but sometimes the optics and trust are worth more than the hotel bill.",1,2025-10-03 16:39:32,2025-10-04 21:34:14
PoliticalDiscussion,hot,What tangible benefits justify the multi-million-dollar cost of in-person summits between national leaders?,7,4,3,"At the end of the day we're monkeys and we operate on monkey basis: trust. We'll are with someone if we trust their word or disagree with them if not. 

While virtual conferences can help exchange information and move the ball forward, at the end of the day getting an agreement will depend on what we think of the other person. 

Conferences don't only connect the top honchos but also all the other levels in the hirarchie. They get to know each other, build working relationships, etc. As we elect a new administration every 4 years, these people often get exchanged at those cycles too.

Having everyone in the room also helps. You seldom get a chance to address the right and important people (again, not only the head honchos) at the same time. A virtual conference allows only single speakers with no quick asides or similar and therefore are far less natural in the way they operate. (I should know, I've designed and implemented virtual conferences). They also are far less flexible in terms of quick discussion rounds or similar because the technical setup is a PITA, especially if you are talking about a high secure environment of hundreds of delegations with various hardware. 

What people seem to be just frustrated about had nothing to do with virtual conferences but the amount of conversations that are necessary to move a ball forward. That's because the process of arriving at an agreement is just as important. 

As you've specified international summits specifically, it's hard to put a price on the reward on it: how valuable are certain accords? What is the downstairs benefit of certain working relationships? Take the Allied WW2 meetings: in the course of the war, there were 3 of them, the first in Theran, the second in Yalta, the third in Potsdam. How valuable were these in terms of happening? Today we say they were invaluable but you couldn't know at the time. And it did mean you are taking high risk of removing the most important authority of a wartime nation for several weeks from their seat of administration. 

So yes, I believe the meetings can be of great value and in person.",1,2025-10-03 16:39:32,2025-10-05 07:03:56

PoliticalDiscussion,hot,Does the shutdown show states are too dependent on federal funding?,0,0,0,"Since the late 19th century, governments of industrialized economies have had lots of expectations on what they must provide, which means that they need to have a significant revenue stream, and the ability to impose regulations for environmental, labor, product safety, etc. It is difficult to impose taxes and regulations in one state if you have no barriers to trade or movement with neighbouring states, and even a common currency. There is a race to the bottom, a collective action problem, and you need to solve it somehow.

In the EU, for example, each member state collects VAT in its own territory, but there are minimum VAT levels, agreed upon standards, etc, and there are similar efforts at harmonizing regulations across member states. And there's still politics around corporate tax havens and legal loopholes exploiting differences in how countries handle corporate taxation - the 'Dutch sandwich' or the 'Double Irish'.

The US has handled this problem by effectively having a federal backstop. There may be some amount of jurisdiction competition, but there was a common level that it couldn't slide below. The problem with this is that a lot of regulation then needs to happen at the Federal level, and a lot of tax revenue ends up being funneled through the federal government. This has advantages too - it is easier for businesses to spread and people to move (with their social security contributions and job qualifications recognized) between US states than it is in the EU even now - but it means that it would be very difficult to reduce the amount of work the federal government is responsible for.

This is (one of) the reason(s) moving more government down to the states would lead to a lot of problems. In the best case scenario, you would lead to a regulatory fragmentation of the US, reducing the economies of scale and free movement that make the US economy so efficient. In the worst case scenario, we end up having having the product safety, labor and environmental standards of the most corrupt state on each issue, and we struggle to pay for education, healthcare, infrastructure, defense, etc.",3,2025-10-01 23:59:26,2025-10-02 04:14:07

Most power in those countries rest with the Parliament and the Parliament has pretty free reign to do what they want, especially if they start acting like Trump and ignore the Bureaucracy.

It really is an American concept that checks and balances are the core to a functioning Democracy, (but I am sure someone will correct me below. I invite that.) 

I just think of the other systems I know well, the UK, France, the Netherlands, and Israel, and for 3 of them, it is basically run completely by Parliament. All it would take is a rogue party to get a majority under a strongman for it all to collapse.

Not to say the US or France are immune from that. I would argue they skip the parties becoming zombies to one man step and overall function much worse as a result of their Presidential systems.

It is all window dressing anyway because no matter how balanced it all is, everything falls a part when guns are being pointed at all sides.",7,2025-09-29 22:52:42,2025-09-30 09:38:07

Of course external pressure and interference contributed and will continue to contribute today, civil wars don't happen in a vacuum - especially in the 20th century but that's exactly why established regimes were so frightened of communism: it made the revolution of the powerless workers its central mantra.

The GOP has no agency, they were obligated to become the modern Trumpist party because of things that didn't even happen, and it is up to the Democrats to bridge the divide by ceasing to exist. 

The divide is almost entirely one-sided. The right is dominated by an extreme right wing and a moderate wing with no coherent belief system besides nihilistic opposition to the Democratic party. The Democratic party has the opposite issue that perpetuates this issue; ""conversations"" and ""debate"" are treated as an end in themselves. Discourse is good, but at a certain point you have to call a spade a spade and acknowledge that people like Shapiro are not engaging in good faith. Treating conversations like that as the solution ignores that Shapiro doesn't actually provide an avenue for mutual compromise.

This is an impossible standard for any form of governance. Without guardrails and balance, nothing is stopping any president or agent of the president from rationalizing themselves above the law. This fundamentally is what makes his presidency unsustainable and doomed to fail. Neither he nor any of his conspirators are above the law. Right now we're dealing with the shock and paralysis he has over the system. But the dust always settles.

This is an administration \*dripping\* with dirty secrets and corruption, with very few people actually qualified to do the job that's required of them. Make no mistake this is not good for our country, but it shows the reality that the administration is very weak. Too many people bound together to escape justice. If Trump were to pass away, JD Vance would inherit a massive amount of power, but without the loyalty and social networks to wield it. The race to be the new “Trump” could echo how the succession of Alexander the Great went. Midterms would flip everything into blue favor, and the admin is picked apart in impeachment and prosecutions amidst infighting. If Trump survives his term… we might very well see the first president refuse to leave office after impeachment.

No President, no person, is above the law. No person can simply do whatever they want. Trumps actions are saying he has the \*desire\* to do anything, and the motivation to act in opposition to the law. In a civilized world, even the person with the greatest influence cannot violate the dignity of the most vulnerable. Trump and his admin have a total disregard for the consequences or effects of their actions. They appear to hold a false worldview and simply demand that it be true, even if it goes against all logic and reason. They routinely and regularly dehumanize and antagonize the citizens they represent, and hold the constitution in contempt. This presidency is a live-fire test on whether the constitution can restrain a president who denies its authority.

Our founders and amenders put in some safe guards to protect against a regime like this, but they never imagined the world we live in and what a demagogue with the ability to influence the media could accomplish. We never stress tested the constitution in this way. Clearly, its having trouble being the supreme law of the land for someone like Trump.

If Trump's precedent takes hold, and this is the way presidents do business, then the future is unforeseeable. We can't plan or imagine a tomorrow if so much of our country can change from leader to leader. Trump's style of governing is simply unable to be a solid framework of governance going forward.

The presidential “winner-takes-all-system” allows for no compromise or proportional representation. Thats why when one side wins the other feels locked out of power, creating higher stakes and driving polarization.

They are PR efforts with minimal actual aid being delivered. Given that, they neither help nor hinder. People have pretty much either chosen to completely shut out Gaza news at this point or taken a position of some type.

Or are there important differences between the two?,188,178,10,"There are a few things going on at present (and have been for a while)

* Atomization and self-segregation of news sources
* Co-opting of those news sources
* Taking advantage of the 24 hr news cycle.
* Gerrymandering
* Court packing

The end goal is to cement control by a very small group of monied interests.

Fox News was explicitly created to prevent another impeachment of a GOP president after Nixon.  
[https://theweek.com/articles/880107/why-fox-news-created](https://theweek.com/articles/880107/why-fox-news-created)

Flooding the Zone is a real tactic that keeps people from focusing on the real core issues. Example: Every time there is a shooting there is a conversation how ""now isn't the time"". What this does is suck up air time during the day so that people talk about that vs. actually doing something.

This does not let people focus on a corrupt act, because there is a new corrupt act. Trump should have been impeached like 10 times by now, never mind jail for MULTIPLE major crimes.

There is also a more sinister part of that. Sometimes called a ""Reverse Cargo Cult"".

[https://bfi.uchicago.edu/insights/the-reverse-cargo-cult-why-authoritarian-governments-lie-to-their-people/](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/insights/the-reverse-cargo-cult-why-authoritarian-governments-lie-to-their-people/)

What this does, in addition to flooding the zone, is drive people to a more cynical attitude. Basically it erodes the populations trust in experts and leaders across the board. e.g., Mask mandates, ivermectin, anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, etc.

>Authoritarian propaganda is not just about spreading lies, it is about shaping the cognitive environment in which citizens make sense of the world. Authoritarian regimes deploy messaging not to persuade in the traditional sense, but to reshape comparison, suppress alternatives, and limit hope. This research offers a powerful framework for understanding how propaganda works—even when no one believes it.

This ultimately leads to the death of empathy and compassion. It's another step to ""othering"" people and groups authoritarians don't like. e.g., the whole crusade against trans people.

Then with the atomization and self-segregation of news sources we have a whole bunch of groups that do not have the same sources of truth. This is how people can have a foundational belief that Trump isn't doing a MASSIVE grift with his meme-coin because they don't hear about it on their news sources, for example. There are people who do not know that ICE has disappeared \~1200 people.

As for co-opting news sources, there's more than a few overlays of Sinclair stations parroting identical talking points.

Gerrymandering basically allows one party to control the legislatures, but also court appointments and news cycles.",10,2025-09-26 02:26:08,2025-09-26 20:37:12

Therein lies the Achilles heel of the ""flood the zone"" approach.

It *sounds* very convincing but it's an idea predicated on short-term thinking that ultimately makes any political project that relies on it less and less feasible as time goes by.

It clearly works, we can see that now, but it eventually creates a problem wherein the information space becomes extremely low trust. That's not a good thing in general, again we see why in the current state of things, but it's bad for people employing the strategy too.

You are part of the information space. If you taint it, you can't then say ""Ok all this other stuff is bullshit but *this* is actually true!"" The political messages you try to employ are then caught up in the churn and treated with as much (if not more) skepticism than everything else. There's no way to exempt yourself from the storm you've created.

The best example of that now is the infighting in MAGA world between people who buy into the conspiracy theories and advance them as real and the people who understand that those were just a cover. The ire directed at Dan Bongino and Kash Patel over the Epstein files is a prime example - MAGA has created a polluted information space and they're not exempt from that.",3,2025-09-26 02:26:08,2025-09-26 22:31:38

PoliticalDiscussion,hot,How Should a Government React to Dangerous Fake News?,64,51,13,"The US government has long claimed the power to censure information in times of national crisis, see Abrams v United States, which was decided in 1919, in favor of the government, 7-2. (I don't claim to have comprehensive knowledge of this, so someone smarter than me may want to address my shortcomings). Is a pandemic a similar national crisis? I would argue that it is. It certainly killed more Americans than America's involvement in WWI. Furthermore, what's knowable about a pandemic is pretty close to binary. The scientific white papers are out there. 


Now, if you get to a claim like ""Trump is a Russian stooge,"" that is still very urgent, but much more gray. Ideally, we would have some kind of framework for determining whether a question is scientific, or political, but I'm sure even before I get to the end of this sentence you can imagine how the semantics would be abused the moment they were adopted. Unfortunately, at the end of the day, I think you need smart, conscientious humans minding the store. In an autocracy, it's an unaccountable government that can imprison anyone. In a democracy, it's the voters, who we have seen in the last ten years, no matter what the Constitution says, clearly can and will bless just about anything. Neither system is perfect.



In many ways, we are in a marketplace-of-ideas place in world history. Countries like China and Russia simply do not allow digital information in from the outside, and censor whatever domestic information they want. Does this make them immune from foreign agitation? And what is that worth? Places like the United States and Europe, seemingly do very little to prevent this sort of malice. In my view, it definitely leads to a lot of wasted time, and bad outcomes, as well-meaning people chase the wrong answers to the right questions. What is that worth? 


If free speech does not lead to enough good outcomes, it eventually won't matter how righteous it is. Any system proposing to temper free speech in the name of good outcomes will have to grapple with that.",20,2025-09-25 22:54:17,2025-09-26 22:00:09
PoliticalDiscussion,hot,How Should a Government React to Dangerous Fake News?,64,51,13,"When you look closer at the statement that is being opined on here, that “pressure” came in the form of “sustained outreach”, and “creating an atmosphere that sought to influence”. 

I’d like to frame a scenario that could easily be described this way by someone looking to drive a certain narrative:

A global pandemic kills millions of people across the world, including a million Americans. It’s a novel virus, so the government and pharmaceutical companies are scrambling to find every way possible to slow the spread and save lives. It is a moral imperative, from people who believe saving lives is more important than political image. 

This pandemic occurs in an unusual time in history, where anything anyone wants to post on the internet can be disseminated to anyone’s pocket with no effort. This leads people to selecting information for bias validation, and not factual accuracy. This poses a distinct problem for the effort to save lives, because some of those ideas are not only false, but malicious and dangerous. They lead to more deaths, and work directly counter to the efforts to slow the virus. 

A government agency, who has a specific task to monitor, track, and combat disinformation on the Internet recognizes the scale of the problem, so begins communicating with social media companies. They provide information on known false narratives, on known foreign interference, and on known disinformation. They may even set up work groups to communicate directly on the project. 

In the end, speech is free and social media companies decide for themselves what is best for their platform. I can see how having someone identifying how disinformation leads directly to loss of life might create an atmosphere where people don’t want that to happen. 

When you take the outcome of this scenario (which has already been identified in detail in the Twitter files, and this story is not so much new information but a fresh retelling), it’s easy to be upset that some content creator you like or media publication you subscribe to is recognized as sharing harmful disinformation. Nobody wants to hear that, and even less, be introspective about it. 

But when you look at the individual actions taken, there is nothing inappropriate. 

The FBI investigates online disinformation. This is a good thing. I would want them to do that. 

The FBI shares information they learn through investigation, with people who have the ability to do something with that information. Also good. Why would we want them to keep potential harms secret?

Social media companies take these claims seriously, and decide to dedicate staff to assessing them. Sounds right. That’s how businesses work. 

Depending on the findings of that analysis, the social media companies make decisions on what to do. As they would. And the fact that they have strong information to base those decisions on, even if those decisions offend the people who have chosen a certain media stream, is not a conspiracy or violation of any rights or principles.",30,2025-09-25 22:54:17,2025-09-26 20:46:17

I was mostly right, but I was shocked by how such a large amount of people could support him even after what he did.

When he incited a mob to attack the capital and stop the counting of the election results, I was convinced that his political career was dead in the water and that people would never consider electing him again.

When he overturned Roe v Wade by appointing far-right extremists to the Supreme Court to give states the right to ban abortion, I was again convinced that he didn't have a chance at being elected again.

When he asked the Georgia Secretary of State to help find him votes, I believed that voters would see him as corrupt and scummy and that they wouldn't think of electing him again.

When he ran on a platform that didn't address the needs of working class at all and instead went on rants about Haitians eating cats and dogs, I thought that he was finally finished and would get trounced in the 2024 election.

I've been proven wrong about the electorate and my faith that people would do the right thing has been shaken.

Trump will never under any circumstances do anything to confront Putin. Trump won't honor any NATO commitments if Russia invades a NATO country, Trump won't shoot down any Russian drones or planes that violate NATO airspace, and Trump won't put any real sanctions on Putin.

Trump has effectively withdrawn the US from NATO. It won't matter what Congress says.

Trump has encouraged NATO to fight back without US help. This might be part of Putin's plan, since without the US NATO is much weaker; once a normal American President is back in office and restores the US position in NATO, Putin will have a much harder time invading.

Look at the policies and ideals of MAGA, and compare those to the four people mentioned. You’ll find they just share little in common anymore. 

MAGA is populist, brazen, anti-compromise and anti-bipartisanship, pro big government, disrespectful, views the other side as evil and the enemy, and anti-institution, among much else. 

The Republican Party of 2012 is just not the same as it is now. The four leaders mentioned were pro small government, respectful, believed in the institutions and sanctity of the US government, believed in fair elections and peaceful transitions of power, did not view the other side as evil or enemies, and would compromise and work together (some).

PoliticalDiscussion,hot,Do past conservative politicians hold less lasting power with their base than past Democratic ones?,51,42,9,"Trump's Republican party is basically a reality show version of politics. It is based on media star power, not adherence to any policies or competence in any field.  I think this trend started with Rush Limbaugh and his hate radio stardom.

Rush made it ok to ignore facts, to be a racist and a sexist, to call people childish names and be generally obnoxious. Anybody who tried to compromise with Democrats was ridiculed and driven from the party.

Bush, McCain, Romney, Reagan, etc, all knew that politics is compromising with the other party. Trump's ""politics"" is basically just a one-man dictator reality show. Facts don't matter, policies don't matter, working with the opposition is abhorrent. It's more like a personality cult than a political party.

Look at who Trump has in his cabinet and who he appoints: Trump himself is a reality show ""star"", Sec of Defense is a drunken FOX news commentator, FBI director was a Trump Media official, US Attorney for DC is another drunken FOX TV commentator, Sec of Transportation another FOX personality, UN Ambassador another FOX person, Ambassador to Israel another FOX person, Special Envoy to Ukraine another FOX person, Border Czar a FOX person.

PoliticalDiscussion,hot,Do past conservative politicians hold less lasting power with their base than past Democratic ones?,51,42,9,"Even with Reagan, at least before he became President, there were some of the more moderate Republicans who thought he was too right-wing.  Reagan's mandate was mainly fed by a backlash against the social and moral permissiveness of the 1960s and 70s, with the so-called ""Moral Majority"" leading the call.  

Reagan's image was largely whitewashed and cultivated by a corporate media which bent over backwards to praise and worship him and his ideals, making him the ""Teflon President.""  Those who loved him only demonstrated just how easily duped and manipulated they can be.

Even liberals I knew who hated Nixon during the 70s, suddenly did a 180 and started worshiping Reagan.  

It was bizarre, and for a brief time, it made me seriously believe that there must have been some kind of mind-control ray which had been turning people into ""Reagan Robots.""  There's a skit on an episode of Saturday Night Live from 1980 (April 19, 1980; S5 E17 - it can be found online) which humorously and almost perfectly captures the essence of the political culture in that time.  Former liberals were suddenly and inexplicably turning into Reagan zombies.  

I think most Republicans were kind of ""meh"" on Romney, McCain, the Bushes, Pence, and others in the GOP who rode in and ascended under Reagan's coattails.  

Another past Republican who is still widely regarded (by both parties) is Dwight D. Eisenhower - although probably more for his military record than his record as President.  Funny thing about Eisenhower was that he was a moderate who could have easily fit in to either party.  Both parties wanted him as their candidate, but he ended up choosing the Republicans.  

And going back further than Eisenhower, the only shining star among the Republicans was Abraham Lincoln.  Republicans used to say that a lot, that they were the ""Party of Abraham Lincoln,"" but I haven't heard them say it as much in more recent times.  

As far as how Democrats view their past leaders, one has to keep in mind that the Democrats have a longer history and a more checkered past than the Republicans do.  

FDR and Truman might have marked the turning point for the Democrats and helped to reshape their image away from the party of Jefferson Davis.  Most Democrats seem to view FDR and Truman positively.  Even Woodrow Wilson seems to have mixed reviews.  While he was still a racist Southern Democrat, he was also somewhat liberal with his New Freedom platform, and he also had a certain internationalist vision which sold better in Europe than in his own country.  

JFK and RFK were also exceedingly popular among young Democrats, and in a way, they kind of symbolized the great shift in the policies and direction America was taking in that decade.  But there were still Democrats like George Wallace - though many of that ilk started a great exodus from the Democrats to the Republicans, who seemingly welcomed them with open arms.  

After that, the Democrats seemed to enter a low period, even despite the opportunity they had in the post-Nixon years, when the country was not too happy with the Republican Party.  I liked Jimmy Carter, but in some ways, I think he might have been in over his head.  

But one lesson I realized during the Carter years - and even more so during Reagan - is that the public perceptions of politics and politicians is oftentimes carefully crafted and manipulated by ways and means of the media and the disseminators of information and opinion.  They create the image that the public sees.  Of course, they're not all of one like mind, and they're in competition with each other, so the images and perceptions oftentimes conflict with each other - as we're seeing nowadays.",6,2025-09-25 03:36:49,2025-09-25 13:59:03

PoliticalDiscussion,hot,What would be the political implications of Andrew Cuomo winning the NYC mayoral election?,89,72,17,"It’s hard to say because a Cuomo win relies on him building a coalition of moderates and Republicans to win. The math is clearly there for Cuomo (he got about 43% in the primary, and Republicans are around 30% in NYC general elections), but it would require Adams and Sliwa dropping out. That would probably translate to a 53-47% win. 

Cuomo’s coalition wouldn’t be reliant on Democrats. Probably the biggest takeaway is that Democrats shouldn’t nominate DSA types because they can’t appeal to people outside of a very narrow Democratic base in upscale neighborhoods. And in some respects that’s still true even if Mamdani wins, since he probably won’t get a majority in a city with a 3:1 Democratic advantage. 

Truthfully, a Mamdani win under 50% is still a kind of symbolic defeat. He’s running against three crackpots in a dark blue city, 50% is the bare minimum he should get.",31,2025-09-24 21:30:04,2025-09-24 23:43:36

Basically, it would actually be the disaster that some of the establishment dems have convinced themselves Mamdani winning would be. Him losing would have a severely negative and perhaps permanently so effect on the democratic party's viability going forward.  Dems simply aren't viable if the left leaves the party.

There's a near zero percent chance this happens though. Most polls have Mamdani winning even one on one. Mamdani is already polling in like the mid 40s typically which makes it nearly impossible even if everyone else dropped out considering Mamdani would certainly pick up the much smaller percentage he would need to win the election.

PoliticalDiscussion,hot,"Why are American conservatives (Trump) so popular in Israel, whereas American Jews are predominantly Democrat?",366,340,26,"American Jews as a demographic are mostly Ashkenazim, meaning their families came to the US from Eastern European countries. Jews in America have largely been a part of the Democratic coalition since the New Deal. Prominent left-wing Israeli politicians like Ben Gurion and Golda Meir were also Ashkenazi and coming from socialist countries in the USSR may have influenced that. American Jews are also highly educated (which correlates with voting left-wing in the US) and are concentrated in states like blue states like New York, Illinois, and California, and purple states like Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Florida.

The majority of Israeli Jews are Mizrahi, which means their family came to Israel from Middle Eastern/Arab countries (or have lived in Israel for several generations). These voters, who experienced living in Arab countries are much more security minded and have experienced/heard stories of the persecution of Jews in Arab lands. One of the reasons that Israel went from having socialist leadership early on like Ben Gurion and Golda Meir, to conservative leadership like Sharon and Netanyahu is that Israel's early immigrants were Ashkenazi and over decades the country grew from Jewish immigrants being kicked out of Muslim countries like Yemen, Iraq, Morroco and migrating to Israel.

Trump is popular in Israel because he is viewed as being unapologetically pro-Israel and pro-Israeli security. He recognized Israeli annexation of the Golan, moved the US embassy to Jerusalem (de-facto recognizing it as Israel's capitol), and has been supportive of the war against Hamas in Gaza (for example Trump negotiated directly with Hamas on the release of an American Israeli captive Edan Alexander). Jews in Israel, receive the benefits of Trump's foreign policy without having to endure his Domestic policy. American Jews are socially liberal, and while many are supportive of Israel, they are more affected by Domestic US policy and vote left for social/economic reasons (abortion is overwhelmingly accepted in Judaism for example).",487,2025-09-22 15:17:28,2025-09-22 22:43:27

PoliticalDiscussion,hot,"Why are American conservatives (Trump) so popular in Israel, whereas American Jews are predominantly Democrat?",366,340,26,"The American Evangelican Christian Right has promoted Israel since the 1970s. The Modern Evangelical Movement is highly Millennialist meaning that its very apocalyptic in a very immediate sense. This strain of Christianity stresses that the end times are going to happen any time now, or that they've already begun and we are now living through their opening stages. This idea creates an immediacy to their faith, that they must get right with God right now *or else.* In their interpretation of the End Times Israel is central to everything that will signal the Anti-Christ and the 1000 years of darkness will occur! In the Jewish Bible *Israel* refers to the Jewish People in covenant with their God, and in the New Testament it refers to the People of God which is anyone who's Christian who's soul is saved. The Evangelical Right has identified the State of Israel, which identifies itself as the nation of the Jewish People, as being their biblical Israel. 

So in a case of strange bed fellows many Evangelical Americans pushed for the US Government to become much more Pro-Israel and much more pro-active in supplying them weapons and regional support. They pushed really hard for about a decade for an American presidential candidate who was openly Pro-Christianity, Pro-""Family Values"", and importantly Pro-Israel. Haaaaaaaaaaaaave you met Ronald Reagan? The Reagan Administration leapt into partnering with Israel, even overlooking cases of Israeli espionage and industrial spying, treating it like another front in the global Cold War. 

Donald Trump is the inheritor of the American Political Right's need to promote Israel for their End of Days prophecies to come true. The Evangelical Right was an early and enthusiastic adopter of Donald J Trump because he made early and enthusiastic overtures to their leaders, who promoted him as The Man who was going to save the soul of America, right all of the wrongs, and who would stand up for their brand of Christianity in a forceful and open manner. I doubt Trump himself, as a private individual, has much regard or interest in Israel. He's reportedly called Jewish People who've worked for him (or who he's butted heads with) some remarkably un-politically correct nick names. Before his Presidency he had no great affinity with the Jewish community of New York as far as I can tell. 

But if he's to be the Defender of the Evangelical Christian Right and its cause, then promoting Israel and protecting it is of course what he's always been in favor of!",29,2025-09-22 15:17:28,2025-09-22 22:49:34

The Democrats were divided on the free trade issue back then, while Republicans were unanimously for NAFTA.  

Without Clinton to flex the party muscle to get the Democrats to support NAFTA, then the Democrats probably would have remained divided - or perhaps even more against NAFTA.  So, if nothing else, the Democrats would not have experienced the exodus of so many blue collar Democrats.  The perception that the Democrats are the party of working people would have remained intact.  

On foreign policy, my sense is that Perot was more of an isolationist, so we probably wouldn't have seen US military involvement in places like Somalia or the former Yugoslavia.  There wouldn't have been any court martial of any US soldier who refused to wear a UN beret (a significant event which was made into a campaign issue by Pat Buchanan and no doubt stuck in the craw of a great many Americans).  

Of course, in reality, Perot hardly made much of a dent in the election, so it's hard to imagine what kind of political atmosphere would have to be in place for that many people from either party crossing over to vote for him.

PoliticalDiscussion,hot,Trump says the tariffs are working and the US is getting richer from it. Is that true?,302,244,58,"1. Are tariffs making the U.S. “richer”?

•           Revenue Gains: Tariffs have indeed generated significant revenue. Between January and July 2025 alone, they brought in about \\$80.3 billion, and projections suggest up to \\$5.2 trillion over 10 years if current policies remain in place.

•           But at a cost: These revenues come with economic downsides. Estimates show U.S. GDP will shrink by 0.8% in the short term and could fall by up to 6% in the long run, with wages dropping about 5% and households facing a lifetime loss of \\$22,000.

•           Household impact: The average U.S. household is effectively paying an extra \\$1,300–\\$2,300 per year due to higher prices from tariffs.

Bottom line: Tariffs raise government revenue, but they act like a tax on consumers and businesses, reducing overall economic welfare.

2. How are tariffs affecting the U.S. economy?

•           Higher Prices & Inflation: Tariffs increase costs for imported goods, which ripple through supply chains. Prices for metals, autos, and consumer goods have surged, with some categories like leather and apparel seeing 35–37% price hikes.

•           Job Market: Employment is projected to decline by 480,000 jobs by the end of 2025, and unemployment could rise by 0.3–0.6 percentage points.

•           Sectoral Shifts: Manufacturing sees modest gains (+2.7%), but construction and agriculture shrink, and overall GDP remains smaller than before.

3. Impact on other countries and global economy

•           Global Slowdown: The World Bank warns of a \\$500 billion drop in global economic activity by 2026, and the IMF cut global growth forecasts by 0.6%.

•           Retaliation: Over 60 countries have retaliated. China imposed 84% tariffs on U.S. goods, targeting politically sensitive sectors like agriculture and autos. This led to bankruptcies among U.S. farmers and major losses for automakers like Ford.

•           Supply Chain Disruptions: Companies like Apple and Tesla are shifting production to India and Europe to avoid tariffs, while rare earth restrictions from China hit U.S. defense and tech sectors.

•           Financial Markets: Stock markets reacted negatively; the S&P 500 fell 3% after major tariff announcements, and currency volatility increased.

4. Strategic Goals vs. Reality

Trump’s tariffs aim to:

•           Reduce trade deficits.

•           Encourage domestic manufacturing.

•           Use tariffs as leverage in global negotiations.

However, these goals come with inflationary pressures, slower growth, and strained global relations. While some reshoring is happening, it’s slow and costly, and global supply chains remain deeply interconnected.

In short: Tariffs are not a free lunch. They generate revenue but act as a hidden tax on consumers, slow economic growth, and create global instability. The U.S. government might be “richer” in terms of tariff revenue, but households and businesses are paying the price.

No, fewer parties is not the answer to negative partisanship, it’s more.

No, if we’re talking about a massive overhaul of how heads of government elections operate then you just have to look at countries who already manage to have those elections without hyper polarization and crib off them. Imo that means no direct elections for heads of government, adopt a parliamentary system where the MPs are elected using something along the lines of party list proportional representation and then allow for either an outright majority to win or for a coalition government to be negotiated (you’re also a helluva lot less likely to see too much partisanship when politicians know they may have to negotiate with some of the other parties to form a government down the road).",1,2025-09-23 02:46:28,2025-09-23 23:20:45

Oppressed people (black, indigenous, LGBTQA+, or what have you) do have a duty to resist as do their fellow citizens have a duty to resist in their defense.

However, as to methods, any framework you arrive at can and will be used by whomever your opponents are. MAGA thinks they are oppressed. They think of themselves are the aggrieved party. I don’t agree with that at all but they do hence Trumps retribution messaging in 2020. 

To use a recent example, Harry Reid ended the use of the filibuster for most presidential nominations (except the Supreme Court) over the objection of Mitch McConnell who promised Republicans would end up taking it a step further if Reid followed through. Republicans later took over the Senate and McConnell announced he was getting rid of the filibuster on judges at the Supreme Court level too leading to Trumps 3 picks. By shattering a norm democrats left themselves open. 

Going back to Rome, if you want a classical example, once minor violence started being allowed near the Senate it escalated until there were basically riots and warring factions killing each other which intern led to their civil war. (this is an oversimplification. Read “the storm before the storm” for a better yelling).

I would say that the ""right"" to resist is self-evident, even if it may not be specifically codified into law.  It's not unlike the right to defend oneself if physically assaulted by a violent attacker.

PoliticalDiscussion,hot,Is using military force against suspected drug-trafficking boats constitutional or an overreach of presidential power?,139,126,13,"This is one of Trumps legal grey areas and it is strictly in how you frame it that states if it is legal or a overreach.

Legal - Using military force against suspected drug trafficking boats can be constitutional and justified, especially when cartels act more like paramilitary threats than ordinary criminals. Under the President’s Article II powers and existing law, including international maritime agreements, the U.S. has legal authority to target such threats in international waters. Arrest isn't always possible, these boats may be armed, evasive, and pose immediate risks. Cartels fuel violence, terrorism, and the opioid crisis, making swift military action a necessary defense tool. This isn’t executive overreach, it’s a response to a modern, transnational threat.

Overreach - Using military force against suspected drug trafficking boats without due process is a dangerous overreach of presidential power. These are suspects, not enemy combatants, and targeting them with lethal force skips arrest, trial, and legal accountability, violating constitutional protections like due process. Labeling traffickers as “terrorists” doesn’t grant unlimited power, otherwise, any group could be targeted without oversight. This sets a troubling precedent for extrajudicial killings and undermines international law. Drug trafficking is a crime, not a war, and the response should involve law enforcement, not missiles. Security must not come at the cost of constitutional limits.",15,2025-09-19 17:55:47,2025-09-19 19:53:36

The media were also decidedly pro-Israel back then and equated any anti-Israel sentiment with antisemitism.  

The fear of being associated with Nazis was enough to keep most people in line.  (Obviously, that fear is not as strong today as it was back then.)  

There was a TV movie which came out around that time called ""Raid on Entebbe,"" which starred Charles Bronson.  I guess one could call it propaganda.  The Palestinians were associated with Idi Amin.  They were also associated with the Soviet Bloc, which made them part of the ""evil empire"" in Americans' eyes.

For comparison, Trump in 2018 made $25 million and paid $1 million in income tax, a rate of 4%. In 2019 Trump's tax rate was 3%. In 2020 Trump lost $4.6 million and got a refund of $5.4 million.

PoliticalDiscussion,hot,"What is ""fair"" for taxes?",0,0,0,"There are a couple of pretty simple approaches. 

Number one is to make capital gains tax rates equal to income tax rates. This notion that the money you make on money is somehow different than income is inherently unfair and favors the wealthy tremendously. 

Number two is to focus more on corporate rates than personal ones. The biggest tax avoidance in the nation is corporate. We often see citations about how high tax rates were under Eisenhower but rarely do we see that specifically mentioned in regard to corporations. Individuals have natural limitations on how they can avoid taxation but companies can easily minimize their tax burden by putting excess profit to work within the company and taking it off the profit margin. Facilities, salaries, research and development are all reinvestment strategies that would help the company and the economy at large without necessarily increasing tax revenue massively. 

We think of the “fair share” terminology in individual terms but all of the richest people are only so wealthy because of their asset value as major shareholders in massive companies. By using tax policy to encourage reinvestment, those individuals would automatically be “worth” less but their companies would be making a more beneficial contribution to the economy on broad terms",14,2025-09-20 16:15:24,2025-09-20 23:02:52

PoliticalDiscussion,hot,"What is ""fair"" for taxes?",0,0,0,"Tax policy is something the people debate strongly about, especially in western countries. Even to the point where it overshadows other concerns, people love talking, campaigning, and worrying, about tax rates. 

I would submit that perhaps its not really about ""what is the best/fair tax rate"" but really ""what system of taxes to put into place where people shut up so we can actually get on with other important matters""? The ""shut up"" aspect is far more important than the exact figure.  It needs to  become a ""settled topic"" so everyone can adjust and move on.

Which never happens, because there is something to complain about at every possible tax level, and most people,politicians and media are making decisions or campaigns on emotional reasons rather than solid data. Also there is political mileage to talk about it like a broken record. But in fact tax rates are just another lever like ""federal reserve interest rates"". There is a good reason that Fed manages interest rates and is insulated from both politics + opinion....taxes are a similar topic.",3,2025-09-20 16:15:24,2025-09-21 05:18:28

As others have noted, it is a messy debate.

Another question that could be asked is, ""What is a fair distribution of wealth?"" Particularly because of its impact on the democratic process. Money has a tremendous impact on political messaging and election outcomes.

If we see taxes as more than simply funding govt, then reduction of wealth is what we are really discussing. The question becomes why should wealth be reduced, and should some of that wealth be openly redistributed?

Zelensky left shortly after. Did Zelensky do the right thing by walking out without any deal?,2171,2105,66,"The Mineral Deal was basically a face-saving one. The original deal proposed was a shakedown. Zelensky basically said never going to happen. Bessent and Rubio were able to basically get Zelensky to do a symbolic concession by signing a deal that basically committed neither the US or Ukraine to anything. It was more or less a symbolic kissing of the ring that meant nothing. The whole visit was arranged probably more as a diplomatic display than a serious negotiation.

My read on the press conference was that it was going pretty well if a bit tense when Vance  saw an opening to purposefully sabotage it by feeding into Trump's ego. Zelensky really only half took the bait but it was enough. This I think is fairly revealing of the internal dynamics going on.

Rubio, Kellogg, and Bessent are all by most accounts fairly pro-Ukraine and want to navigate this minefield and figure out how to stroke Trump's ego while continuing as much support as possible to Ukraine. Trump is basically only concerned with stroking his ego and making money. He is much more interested in the idea of business opportunities in Russia and Ukraine and how much money this will make the US than any coherent idea of US interest. He likes Putin more than Zelensky but thats basically how he sees this deal. Vance on the other hand is really Russia's greatest ally in the US. Vance hates the European liberal democracies and sees the US exiting more comfortably in an alliance with christian conservative states like Russia. This is really I think a combination of two strains of conservative thought

The first is this sort of dumb realist argument that many conservatives are obsessed with of turning Russia into a US ally by granting it a sphere of influence in a global competition against China. Morality aside,  This will never work because Russia hates us, would basically collapse economically if it broke with China, and could never trust the US two party system to maintain that understanding. The second and more important fight though of course is that conservatives perceive their real enemy as the ""progressive order"" and thus undermining the cultural ties with other western liberal states is a feature not a bug.",225,2025-02-28 19:31:28,2025-02-28 19:44:57

PoliticalDiscussion,top,How is Trump Getting Away with Everything?,1798,1672,126,"My genuine answer is twofold:


First, everyone who opposes this stuff seems to be operating under this presumption that, at some point, there will be a hard stop somewhere. A line that, literally, cannot be crossed. Like ""Okay, he's saying all this stuff, but he can't actually go through with it. The courts will stop him."" and then the courts don't stop anything by enacting any real punishment, and people go on the news saying they'll openly defy the court, and people say ""Well, sure, but I guess nobody is putting their foot down because it's not that bad, or that illegal."" and they all wait for something, somewhere to stop things, or enact some kind of failsafe like a governor in a cars speedometer that slows you down if you go too fast.


Second, and this is the big one, I think anything that could've potentially derailed his political ambitions has been just ""not that bad"" enough to let him skate by. Things were always not nearly as bad as they could've been.The Access Hollywood tape, for example. Could've been much worse. I've heard people say much worse, for sure. But it was just ""not that bad"" enough for people to handwave it off. The pandemic, again, was only a respiratory virus that felt like the flu (that people were already familiar with) and the deaths that it caused were less dramatic than with something like, say, rabies where there's a really dramatic mental shift and a pretty dramatic death in a short window. If people were going insane in the street, refusing water, and you basically had to watch your family go feral and die in a week, that probably would not have caused the political division over vaccines. Jan 6, same thing. I think if it'd been an absolute bloodbath, if the shooting of Ashli Babbitt had caused an out and out firefight in the capital building, I think that would've been insane enough that politicians would've said okay, this is enough, we have to take a stand for it. But it was just ""not that bad"" enough in relation to what it could've been that people were not only fine with sweeping it under the rug, they basically rebranded it as a guided tour and everybody got pardoned.",87,2025-03-19 00:34:24,2025-03-19 02:18:39

PoliticalDiscussion,top,"Do You Think the US is Moving in a ""Fascist"" Direction?",1734,1560,174,"Albright warned that fascism does not always come through violent revolutions but can rise gradually, exploiting public fears, economic instability, and dissatisfaction with the political system. These were her bullet points to look out for.

* **Strongman Leadership & Authoritarianism** A single leader or ruling elite consolidates power, often disregarding democratic norms. Institutions that provide checks and balances are weakened or dismantled.
* **Disregard for Truth & Manipulation of Reality** Leaders use lies, conspiracy theories, and propaganda to distort facts. The press is labeled as the “enemy of the people” to undermine independent journalism.
* **Exploitation of Nationalism & Division** Extreme nationalism is used to rally support, often by scapegoating minorities or outsiders. Society is divided into “us vs. them,” where certain groups are demonized.
* **Encouraging Violence & Suppressing Opposition** Fascist leaders condone or encourage violence against political opponents and critics. Protests and free speech are repressed through intimidation or force.
* **Corrupt Use of Power & Weakening of Institutions** Democratic processes, such as elections and judicial independence, are undermined. Loyalty to the leader is prioritized over competence and rule of law.
* **Contempt for Democracy & Individual Rights** Fascists see democracy as weak and inefficient, advocating for stronger, unchecked leadership. Rights such as free speech, privacy, and assembly are restricted.

I don't understand why people keep using hyperbole when talking about fascism. Everyone can see it but so many are afraid to admit it because they don't want it to be true. We are there.

PoliticalDiscussion,top,"Do You Think the US is Moving in a ""Fascist"" Direction?",1734,1560,174,"Alright so here's what's happening that's in a ""fascist direction"" the way I see it.

First of all, Executive Orders are built on sand and a lot of the ones he signed just aren't enforceable. 

What \*is\* dangerous, though, are a few things:

1) Pardoning of Jan 6th defendants - This is a play to get the militias to do what he wants because now they owe him. These are your SS, your brownshirts, your vigilantes. This is what I'm primarily worried about.

2) The utter capitulation of legacy/corporate media - This was near-instant, and is unique to Trump's presidency. It bodes poorly for the ability of the opposition to coordinate and for everyday people to receive accurate and reliable information about what Trump is doing.

3) Hegseth/Patel/Gabbard - These people are in government just to do what Trump wants, and his ability to control the FBI and National Intelligence Services against the safety and security of the United States, as well as to prosecute opposition candidates and the people who investigated Jan 6th, is extremely dangerous. Hegseth is a bridge between the military and the militias, which makes him especially dangerous.

I would like to remark that no matter what anyone Trump nominated says in front of Congress, they are lying. We saw this with Brett Kavanaugh, and now literally anyone can say whatever they want to Congress (""No, I won't pursue Trump's political opponents..."" and what have you), get in, and face zero consequences. Patel \*will\* do Trump's bidding; he has a long and extensive history of conspiracy theories and buys in to Trump's grievances.

4) RFK Jr - This is a special case because his antivax stances are going to kill a lot of people, especially children, and Trump's own voters are uniquely vulnerable after the pandemic because they are also antivax. He's not so much fascist as just completely reckless and irresponsible.

5) Undocumented migrants - This one we've seen before, and it might be a trial run for something worse later. Texas has already promised use of its land to build \*ahem!\* *camps* to house migrants. It's worth noting that citizens, including military veterans, have been caught up in ICE's dragnet. Watch this space.",147,2025-02-01 00:09:16,2025-02-01 02:40:52

It's possible the US is preplacing assets to support the USAF in the event attacks destroy their fueling infrastructure, but I think given all the other tea leaves the US is planning to at least provide logistical support for the IDF, as the IAF does not have a great deal of air to air refilling capability.

I would not be surprised to see US air and naval assets used in theatre, given the general US stance towards Iran since 1979, and the love of strength the current administration has in particular, but I don't think it's especially likely that we have boots on the ground or anything like that.",100,2025-06-17 00:57:39,2025-06-17 01:01:41

And he's probably right, Putin isn't welcome and Trump isn't either, really.

As for Iran and Israel, Netanyahu doesn't care what Trump thinks or says. He knows that Trump is weak and easily manipulated. The Iranians know that the US isn't to be trusted, even when they spent years negotiating a deal with the US. Trump came in and abruptly tore up the agreement, the Iranians know that what Trump says is just BS. He can't be trusted.

Netanyahu obviously wants the US to join the war against Iran, Israel can't really fight Iran on its own. Iran is twice the size of Texas with 90 million people. All Israel can do is conduct terrorist attacks and remote bombing, they are not going to invade Iran to conquer it.

Trump told Iran to evacuate Tehran. Is that because Israel is going to use a nuclear weapon? Pakistan said if Israel nukes Iran, then Pakistan will nuke Israel. Or was that just more of Trump's tough talk that means nothing?",12,2025-06-17 00:57:39,2025-06-17 12:06:55

Flipside, I am not convinced Trump would have lost the election from inside a prison cell.  The information that he was convicted of 34 felonies and on trial for other felonies was readily available at election time, and it did not seem to sway voters.  I also think he could have justified trips out of prison for his campaigns and rallies because he was on the presidential ballot.

When he incited a mob to attack the capital and stop the counting of the election results, I was convinced that his political career was dead in the water and that people would never consider electing him again.

When he overturned Roe v Wade by appointing far-right extremists to the Supreme Court to give states the right to ban abortion, I was again convinced that he didn't have a chance at being elected again.

When he asked the Georgia Secretary of State to help find him votes, I believed that voters would see him as corrupt and scummy and that they wouldn't think of electing him again.

When he ran on a platform that didn't address the needs of working class at all and instead went on rants about Haitians eating cats and dogs, I thought that he was finally finished and would get trounced in the 2024 election.

I've been proven wrong about the electorate and my faith that people would do the right thing has been shaken. There is a chance that Trump will declare himself King in 2028 and refuse to leave office, knowing that the majority of the population would shrug their shoulders and let him get away with everything just like they have since 2016.

The truth is that it's very difficult to tell how much America is willing to tolerate from its leader, because every time we hit a rock bottom he drags us even further down. America feels adrift without any clear direction, like its lost in the woods. One third of the country is cheering on the wrongdoing, one third is shocked and horrified, and one third is apathetic and tunes it all out.

My reason isn't so wishful.  Judges in American courts are highly protective of their authority.  Snub one of their rulings or act out of order in their presence, and they will predictably get agitated about it.

This is true across the spectrum.  Federal or state/local.  Liberal, conservative, or anywhere in between: Piss off a judge and you're hosed.

I believe that they may start holding these DOJ lawyers in contempt and fining them personally for every day that their orders are defied.  The Supreme Court will back them on this because they also don't like their rulings being disrespected.  What they won't want is another branch of government treating them as if they have no power.

Judges can often be petty and that is usually a bad thing.  This is where it may do some good.

PoliticalDiscussion,top,"The Republican ""Big Beautiful Bill"" has passed.

Medical insurance will go up for everyone - ACA recipients, Medicare recipients, and private insurance. Medical costs and prescription costs will go up for everyone - when folks get on the ER only plan it increases costs across the whole system. Considering we fixed absolutely nothing after COVID with hospital staffing, we still have skeleton crews and hospitals wait times are already incredibly high… those wait times will increase. 

In short, a lot of people will die because of this bill. The federal government is the largest insurer in the US, this Congress and Trump just stripped a big chunk of federal negotiating power. It’s going to decimate the medical industry. As many have pointed out, yes, it won’t “take effect” for a couple years, but these will be the results. 

In terms of SNAP, we will see childhood hunger increase again - after decades of work to erase it. Families will go hungry and we don’t have the infrastructure to replace SNAP with private or nonprofit resources. By the way, there’s a stat that for every dollar spent on food assistance, poverty assistance, unemployment, etc we get back on average $7. A 700% ROI into the economy, the GDP, and tax revenue - that’s gone. 

Democrats should run on this and making life affordable again for ALL Americans, nonstop for the foreseeable future until everyone who voted for this bill is out. I don’t care if the effects are delayed - those who rely on these benefits are paying attention and they’re scared and angry - don’t let them forget this.

That is what a democracy does in the face of violence. It waits for facts, it honours the dead, and it upholds justice without weaponising grief. But that’s not what happened in the United States. Elon Musk jumped online and branded the left “the party of murderers” before anyone knew the shooter’s motive. That isn’t just reckless. It is a deliberate act of incitement. He knows his words will be repeated, amplified, and believed. He knows he can smear millions as killers with a single post. And he knows it drags America closer to civil conflict.

Donald Trump followed with the same poison. He blamed the “radical left” without a shred of evidence. It wasn’t a mistake. It was the script. Accuse first. Invent facts later. Repeat until truth is unrecognisable. That is not democracy. That is authoritarianism. It is the same tactic Putin uses to justify war. The same tactic Xi uses to crush dissent. And now it is the tactic of Trump and Musk. Not to strengthen America, but to dismantle it from within.

The hypocrisy is not subtle. Two months ago, a MAGA extremist murdered a Democratic state legislator, her husband, and their dog. Another state senator and his wife were shot and barely survived. The attacker carried a kill list of dozens more Democrats. And what was the Republican response? Silence. No outrage. No demands for action. No mourning of public servants executed for their party affiliation. Nothing.

This silence is not new. It is part of the record. A Trump supporter mailed live pipe bombs to Democrats and journalists. Armed extremists plotted to kidnap and execute the governor of Michigan. On 6 January, Trump told his followers to “fight like hell.” They stormed the Capitol. They hunted lawmakers through the halls of Congress. They beat police officers bloody. They carried Confederate flags through a building that symbolises the Republic itself. And Trump sat back and called them “patriots.” He promised them pardons.

In 2025, he delivered. Nearly 1,600 rioters had their sentences wiped clean. Leaders of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers convicted of sedition walked free. Men with long records of violence, abuse, child exploitation, sexual crimes, absolved. These were not patriots. They were criminals. And instead of punishment they got protection. Some now have the audacity to sue the government, demanding millions from the very democracy they tried to burn down.

This is not random hypocrisy. This is sabotage. It is a conscious project to hollow out democracy and replace it with chaos. Musk and Trump feed the machine with lies. They turn tragedy into propaganda. They excuse extremists when they wear the right hat, and they smear opponents as murderers when they don’t. They are not stumbling into danger. They are building it.

And here is the clearest proof: compare America to other democracies. Brazil faced the same challenge. Jair Bolsonaro tried to cling to power after losing in 2022. He plotted a coup. He incited riots. He fed the same lies of a “stolen election.” And what happened? Brazil’s institutions held. Bolsonaro was tried, convicted, and sentenced to 27 years in prison for plotting insurrection, leading a criminal group, and undermining democracy. Twenty-seven years. That is what accountability looks like. That is how a democracy survives.

Now look at the United Kingdom. Only yesterday the UK government fired its ambassador to the United States for ties to Jeffrey Epstein. Peter Mandelson had emails defending Epstein, calling him “best pal,” coaching him to fight his conviction. The moment this became undeniable, he was sacked. No excuses. No protecting a powerful man because of his connections. No pretending it didn’t matter. Action was taken immediately. That is how democracies defend their legitimacy.

And now look back at America. Donald Trump, a man with his own ties to Epstein, a man who incited an insurrection, a man who promised and delivered pardons to seditionists, sits as President again. Not in exile, not in prison, not disgraced. Elected. Empowered. Protected. That is not democracy. That is rot. It is a global embarrassment.

If I wanted to design a machine to collapse America from within, I wouldn’t need to invent one. I would hand the microphone to Elon Musk and the stage to Donald Trump. Between them, they already serve as that machine. They spread lies. They legitimise violence. They shield extremists. They corrode institutions. They have written the script for America’s slow self-destruction. And the country, eyes wide open, follows them step by step toward collapse.

Democracy has rules. Evidence comes before accusation. Violence is punished, not excused. Power is checked, not worshipped. Corruption is exposed, not ignored. That is how Brazil defended itself. That is how the UK defended itself. That is how functioning democracies survive. The United States has abandoned these principles. It protects the guilty and persecutes the innocent. It weaponises tragedy. It pardons traitors.

This is not leadership. This is treason by another name. It corrodes democracy, destabilises society, and hands victory to America’s enemies abroad. Unless it is confronted, unless it is called out for what it truly is, an organised campaign to normalise violence, excuse extremists, and destroy trust, the collapse will not be an accident. It will be a choice. And it will be the end of the American Republic.",100,2025-09-12 03:20:17,2025-09-12 04:22:22

PoliticalDiscussion,top,Why do Trump and Musk keep pushing the Social Security fraud narrative?,1021,980,41,"Trump wants to give tax cuts to rich people,  but he can’t, deficits are already too big. He has to cut something. But nothing is big enough. Most of the federal government expenses are Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the military and interest on the national debt.Everything else put together, foreign aid, NASA, the Justice Department, National Parks, the CDC, border patrol, etc… doesn’t come close to those big items. They could get rid of literally the entire US government, besides those five things, and still not be able to balance the budget, let alone cut taxes more.

What Trump wants to do is impossible, what DOGE says they are going to do (2 trillion in cuts) is impossible. All they are doing is making a lot of noise firing all those federal workers. It won’t have much of an effect on the deficit and certainly not pay for Trump tax cuts. So they have to attack something big like Social Security.  But people like Social Security so they need a reason to cut it that people will accept. Finding waste, fraud and abuse (I’m so sick of hearing those terms) is a handy cliche and is good political theater they can use to justify doing something everybody is going hate. It also justifies the existence of DOGE, something else a lot of people are hating on, if they are out there fighting the boogie man. That fact that the boogie man is made up matters not even a little bit. As long as they can convince enough people that the boogie man is real and is a threat it lets them do whatever they want.

Musk and Trump are really good and absolutely relentless at weaving whatever reality suits their ambitions. They’ll keep at it no matter how dumb the narrative is is or how thoroughly it’s been debunked.

I appreciate him stepping up, but I know he’s ambitious and wants to be President. That being said, Democrats being afraid of power or reluctant to take power is one of their biggest faults. So maybe that’s a trait we need.

Trump gleefully embraced the Epstein meme, as pedophilia is salacious and engaging for his bloodthirsty base - and American society in general - but it appears this was another example of Trump's projection.

I think Trump is panicking because he's in deeper than most of Epstein's other clients. Virginia Giuffre was recruited from Mar-a-Lago by Ghislane Maxwell. Trump owned Miss Teen USA starting in 1996, and Trump Model Management in 1999. Was Giuffre really the only woman trafficked through Trump's numerous businesses centered around young women? Once you take even more than a cursory look at their relationship it stinks.

The media slow walking this is icing on the cake. The Washington Post has played the administration again and again, with Trump's team sleepwalking into unforced error after error.

PoliticalDiscussion,top,Is the Epstein scandal the biggest blunder & own goal by the conservative MAGA movement?,1024,993,31,"The Republicans have protected Epstein since at least 2005.  

2005 - March 2005: Police in Palm Beach, Florida, begin investigating Epstein after the family of a 14-year-old girl reported she was molested at his mansion. Multiple underage girls, many of them high school students, would later tell police Epstein hired them to give sexual massages.

May 2006: Palm Beach police charge Epstein with multiple counts of unlawful sex with a minor. The county’s top prosecutor, State Attorney Barry Krischer, takes the unusual step of sending the case to a grand jury.

June 2006: The grand jury hears from only ONE accuser and indicts Epstein with one count of solicitation of prostitution. Accusations from other victims, many of whom were minors, are NOT EVEN INCLUDED in the indictment.

July 2006: The relatively minor charge draws attention, including from Palm Beach Police leaders, who slam Krischer for giving Epstein special treatment. The FBI opens a federal investigation that involves multiple accusers in Florida, New York and elsewhere in the U.S.

2007: Federal prosecutors prepare an indictment against Epstein. But for a year, the financier’s lawyers engaged in talks with the U.S. attorney in Miami, ALEXANDER ACOSTA, about a plea bargain that would allow Epstein to avoid federal prosecution. Epstein’s lawyers argued that his accusers are unreliable witnesses.

June 2008: Epstein pleaded guilty to one count of soliciting prostitution and one count of soliciting prostitution from a minor. He was sentenced to 18 months in jail, a year of community service and is registered as a sex offender.
Under a secret arrangement, the U.S. attorney’s office agreed not to prosecute Epstein for federal crimes. Epstein served most of his sentence in a work-release program that allowed him to leave the jail during the day to go to his office and return to his cell at night. Amazing - Acosta crafted a secret deal for a pedophile!!!

July 2009: Epstein is released from jail. For the next decade, multiple women who say they are Epstein’s victims wage a legal fight to get his federal non-prosecution agreement voided, and hold him and others liable for the abuse.

November 2018: The Miami Herald revisited the handling of Epstein’s case in a series of stories focusing partly on the role of Acosta — who by this point is President Donald Trump’s labor secretary — in arranging his unusual plea deal. The coverage renews public interest in the case.

July 2019: Epstein is arrested on federal sex trafficking charges after federal prosecutors in New York concluded they weren’t bound by the earlier plea deal. Days after the arrest, Acosta resigned as labor secretary amid public outrage over his role in the initial investigation.

August 10, 2019: Guards find Epstein dead in his cell at a federal jail in New York City. Investigators concluded he died by suicide.

So from 2005 sexual abuse of a 14-year old to 2019, Republicans lied and protected Epstein, his associates and his wealthy, powerful pedophile clients, in fact he continued to traffick teenagers from his release in 2009 to his arrest in 2019, he had 10 years to freely abuse and rape kids and no one did anything to stop him.

Acosta is

What deeper meaning, if any, should be taken from this?",941,903,38,"I think some of the comments here are missing the mark of what I found most interesting - 50% of the voters are under the age of 44.

There is a huge demographic shift happening and in the works. Cuomo was a bad candidate, but in practicality he was leading every poll in a commanding lead before this young guy with the right energy showed up and went from what, dead last to \*crushing\* a victory in record time. He got people to knock on 1.5 million fucking doors -- all with no money, and only a bit of charisma and giving voice to values that people care about.

To me, the significance is not about how it shakes the Democrats (though that is certainly a consideration), the important thing here is to note the demographic shift. Young people are coming out. Things like this are going to show them that money does not win elections -- it's hitting on the topics that people care about and giving them a voice, that \*does\*.

Healthcare, Childcare, Work/Life balance, pay equity, equitable taxation, etc are things that not Zohran was elected for -- it was what TRUMP was elected for. There's a groundswell of people that viciously are voting for the things that they find important, and the ""hey I'll give you a $200 tax cut"" approach of the people in the past simply does not work any more. You have to speak to the things that people care about, and it is addressing the wealth gaps, the lack of healthcare, and the inability to buy a home and start a family.

Zohran won because he voiced those things and gave value to them, so the younger voters felt some energy and came out to vote for what values he was espousing. They delivered him the victory. And this point can be replicated over and over, in almost any area with the right charismatic candidate, and win elections. And Democrats need to come to terms with that and start running candidates that espouse those values, rather than the corporate Democrats of the past.",8,2025-06-25 09:55:42,2025-06-25 13:47:04

If anyone was paying attention during the election the Harris campaign was sounding the alarm that his plan would blow up the deficit (although her plan would too, just not as much according to economists)

PoliticalDiscussion,top,What would it take to flip republicans against trump?,848,780,68,">Empirical work exists showing that ***most people support a party because they believe it contains people similar to them***, **not because they have gauged that its policy positions are closest to their own.** Specifying what features of one’s identity determine voter preferences will become an increasingly important topic in political science.

>[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5120865/pdf/nihms819492.pdf](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5120865/pdf/nihms819492.pdf)

Party affiliation is more a matter of club membership than it is about policy.  Most people choose the party that appears to have ""people like me.""

To break Trump's support, efforts need to made so that the club members want to turn on Trump, on their terms.  They need to stop seeing him as being people like me.

Many Trump voters see him as a patriotic and tough winner.  They need to come to see him as an unpatriotic and weak loser, *as they define it*.

Democrats tend to focus on what they perceive to be his meanness.  But many of his fans see that as a positive quality or they perceive it as a show of strength, so that approach ultimately backfires.

Trump opponents need to attack him with terms such as ""incompetent"", ""weak"" and ""failed"".  They need to mock him for being a screwup rather than making him appear to be tough by fearing him.

The threat to democracy argument does not move marginally attached Democrats.  Devoted Trump supporters believe that there is a threat to democracy, but that it's the Democrats who pose the threat.  So that angle needs to be punted post haste.",911,2025-04-04 21:28:26,2025-04-04 23:22:17

In reality, I think that what will end up happening is that all of this is going to benefit China. It will force the EU to militarize and thus increase their industrial capacities. It increase the importance of the African Union and their member nations, perhaps being taken with more urgency for relations with the EU. And it will make it so that nations will look to replace American dependencies overtime, which will make Trump's hand weaker over time, especially when Trump is facing a harsh recession entirely of his own doing.

PoliticalDiscussion,top,"If Trump/Musk are indeed subverting American democratic norms, what is a proportional response?",744,699,45,"People bitch about Republican voters. Here's the thing, they are primarily a product of the propaganda they consume. Most of them rarely see any news outside of Fox News. They're immersed in it, and it shapes their opinion.

If you want to really respond, the first response needs to be directed not a Trump, but at the right wing media. You've got to try and change the information diet the MAGA folks are on. Only then will it be possible to shift the political landscape.

There are two angles to approach the problem from. The first is money - make it a business liability to support Fox News. Boycott advertisers. Protest them. Picket their main office. Make them want to pull their ads.

The second is to provide an alternate flood of information. This does not mean arguing with them or calling them names. This means providing the same appeal that their existing information provides - play to their outrage, tell them they're smart. But let the payoff reveal facts. Kind of an ""IQ Anon"" to feed their addiction.  
  
Or just use your info stream to turn them against the backseat enablers of the right wing media. Wouldn't it be a shame if the producers of a Fox News show were implicated in a right wing conspiracy theory? Started getting irate calls from MAGA folks?

It's because they spent the previous five+ years releasing one colossal, expensive disaster after another, burning consumer goodwill more and more each time, coasting on past success, until a powerful, disruptive new player comes in and utterly embarrasses them. 

By the time they got their shit together and actually learned from their mistakes, it was too late. Their name had been too tarnished by their mistakes and failures. People expected Sega to fail, or to let them down, and so many of them ignored the Dreamcast, even if it appealed to their tastes and sensibilities. And thus, it became a tragedy.

PoliticalDiscussion,top,Who is benefiting from these tariffs?,653,633,20,"Yes, tariffs are a tax, paid by American importers, and typically passed on to American consumers.  That money goes into the general fund along with all the other tax dollars that the US collects.  This is probably the largest tax hike in US history.   If you're a deficit hawk, you might be excited about closing the deficit, except that Trump has said that he's not going to use this revenue to pay down the deficit, he's going to cut taxes elsewhere.  


Even worse, it's almost guaranteed that other countries will retaliate, which means American exporters will also suffer.  So people are going to be losing jobs as well as suffering higher prices.  


But it's worth it, to bring back American manufacturing, right?  But it's not going to do that either.  Factories take many years to build.  Longer than an election cycle.  Raising taxes and a recession are a death sentence  for the Republican party.  If I'm a manufacturing company, I'm not going to build any new factories, I'm going to ride this out and wait for Democrats to remove these tariffs.  So manufacturing doesn't win either.


No one wins here.  It's such a monumentally stupid thing to do.  ",1679,2025-04-02 21:48:50,2025-04-03 00:23:47

PoliticalDiscussion,top,Who is benefiting from these tariffs?,653,633,20,"Basically no one.

I know people often like to say that the economic elite want the economy to crash because then they can buy things for cheap, but that's honestly just goofy conspiracy-mongering.  It's not like they can just crank a dial to ""crashed"", buy everything, then crank it back to ""good"" and now they have everything and nothing else has changed.  Business owners want a good economy because then they have more money and then they have more stuff.  The 2008 Great Recession was not good for anyone.  No one wanted that to happen.

The most dangerous thing about Trump's presidency isn't that it's populated by people who are cynically just trying to get rich.  That would lead to at least a more or less functional economy, even if it would be better for them than anyone else.  The most dangerous thing is that it's populated by actual, genuine true believes in complete nonsense.  Trump genuinely believes that the best way to be a head of state is just punching everyone in the face and taking their lunch money.

PoliticalDiscussion,top,Why isn't Congress acting to preserve its power?,640,614,26,"Thom Tillis serves as a good case study:

>Mr. Trump had gotten word that Senator Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, planned to oppose Pete Hegseth, the former “Fox & Friends” weekend host who was his choice for Pentagon chief, and who faced accusations of excessive drinking and abusing women. If Mr. Tillis could not be brought to heel by that night, there would be enough Republican “no” votes to sink Mr. Hegseth’s confirmation, a humiliating defeat at the dawn of Mr. Trump’s second term.

>Turning to a group of North Carolina lawmakers who were flying with him to survey storm damage in their state, Mr. Trump noted Mr. Tillis’s impending defection and posed a question: Which of them wanted his endorsement for a primary challenge to the senator next year?

>The implication was clear: Mr. Tillis’s refusal to back Mr. Hegseth could cost him his seat. By that night, Mr. Tillis, who had been toiling behind the scenes for days to kill Mr. Hegseth’s nomination so he could avoid having to publicly cross Mr. Trump, would vote to confirm Mr. Hegseth to control the most powerful military force in the world.

>The story of Mr. Tillis’s secret effort to persuade fellow Republicans to join him in opposing Mr. Hegseth — and his sudden turnabout when it became clear he would be the deciding vote to defeat the nominee — is a tale of political calculation and capitulation by a single G.O.P. senator.

>But it also helps explain a broader dynamic at play with Mr. Trump back in the White House, as Republicans in Congress, fearful of reprisal by the president and his supporters, have put aside grave reservations and surrendered to his demands.

You can read about it [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/us/politics/hegseth-trump-tillis-senate.html).

The tl;dr is that, currently, Republicans in Congress feel that ~~defined~~ defying Trump puts them at greater risk of losing re-election than standing up for their constituents. This may change in time, but so early in his honeymoon period, it simply leaves them too vulnerable. 

The article offers another example, Joni Ernst: 

>Senator Joni Ernst, the Iowa Republican and former combat veteran and sexual assault survivor, had been a cautionary tale. After she publicly raised concerns about Mr. Hegseth, Mr. Trump’s hard-line supporters applied unrelenting pressure on Ms. Ernst, including threatening a primary challenge to her re-election bid next year. She retreated, saying she would not try to stand in the way of Mr. Hegseth’s confirmation.

As long as Trump has a death-like grip on Republican primary voters, he has a death-like grip on their elected representatives.

PoliticalDiscussion,top,Why isn't Congress acting to preserve its power?,640,614,26,"The Republican Party believes in power over principles, in profits over people. They only care that Trump gave them power, power to make more money via taxcuts and deregulation, they don’t care about anything else. A Congressional salary is $174K per year (except for like House Speaker), but after Citizens United, lobbyists and SuperPACS can give politicians unlimited money, anonymously. Elon Musk spent $290M to elect Trump, then saw his wealth increase by $200B due to stock market speculators. John Kenneth Galbraith said “The modern conservative is engaged in one of man's oldest exercises in moral philosophy; that is, the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness.”

Whereas George Washington warned about political parties in his farewell address for that very reason.

Republicans who control Congress are all still scared to death of the dumb Trump mob who attacked Congress & wanted to hang conservative Christian Republican Vice President Mike Pence (who dared to uphold his oath to the Constitution & stand up to Trump). Any Republican who criticizes Trump is labeled a heretic, a “RINO” (even lifelong Republicans, even though Trump was a Democrat until 2009), and banished from the party for “wrongthink.” Only Republicans who have left office, or who are about to leave office, seem to find the courage to criticize Trump. Criticizing Trump has proven to be a political death sentence for several Republicans (unless they later get in line, like Secretary of State Marco Rubio).

[Rightwing authoritarians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_authoritarian_personality) believe we need a mighty leader who will do whatever it takes to defeat the evil creeping into society. About [25%](https://www.businessinsider.com/26-percent-of-americans-are-right-wing-authoritarian-new-poll-2021-6) of Americans are authoritarians. And people who grew up with [authoritarian parents](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/the-legacy-distorted-love/201912/authoritarian-parenting-and-polarization-in-politics) tend to vote for authoritarian politicians. This explains all the weird Republicans calling Trump “daddy” or saying “daddy’s home.”

David Frum wrote “If conservatives become convinced that they can not win democratically, they will not abandon conservatism. They will reject democracy.” Which the Republican Party did in 2020 (and which the Supreme Court arguably did in 2000).

On January 6, 2021, the head of the US Executive Branch, Donald Trump, incited an assault on the entire Legislative Branch, hoping to remain in power, which are the actions of a tyrant or despot, a traitor to our constitutional, representative democracy, presidential republic. But the US court system is so slow (and Trump’s lawyers successfully delayed for so long), that Trump just had to wait 4 years to run & win again.

Republicans in Congress are blindly following the lawless convicted felon they nominated 3x in a row, because Trump was so popular with the poors that the GOP decided idiot Trump was “too big to fail.” The greatest trick the Republican Party ever pulled was getting the poors to vote for billionaires, especially foreign billionaires like Musk & Murdoch. The poors who voted Trump think it’s more likely they’ll become a billionaire, when in reality they’re more likely to become homeless.

Donald Trump is like heroin to white trash in America (and VP Vance said as much, before he also got in line), but the only jobs that Trump seems to be creating for rural communities are Trump Stores where people sell Trump merchandise to other Trumpfans.",9,2025-02-19 19:14:33,2025-02-20 11:39:16

The second, and the one I worry about, is that some agencies have been excepted from it knowingly by Trump/Musk/other senior decision makers. Essentially, that the agency leadership that has told employees not to respond, are the agencies that have been given permission to do so. 

I’m leaning towards the latter, and that DOGE-occupied OPM just takes a wrecking ball approach to what it does, with little actual coordination on the execution.

Those who believe they are closest to him will try to carry out his whims but they are also vying for power and influence internally.

Trump loves this as it means everyone has to come running to him or risk looking stupid when a truth social post comes out saying the opposite.  At the very least Musk is running to Trump saying make them comply and they're checking in to make sure they haven't overstepped by telling their people not to respond.

There's been a lot of Doom saying it's about the state of the American government lately, and a lot of that Doom saying is justified.

There are a few people in the Trump administration that wish it did work that way. There are a few genuine ideologues, like Steven Miller (which is why I think he is by far one of the most dangerous members of Trump's entourage). But overwhelmingly, Trump's alliance is made up of a bunch of self-interested grifters. They are all willing to play nice so long as they believe that it will gain them power and influence, but ultimately these people only care about themselves. The moment they start stepping on each other's toes and asking one another to make sacrifices, that's when the coalition starts to fracture.

PoliticalDiscussion,top,What is Elon Musk’s end goal?,612,569,43,"Many are brining up Curtis Yarvin and Techno Fascism and I think that's more of what JD Vance's angle would be given that JD Vance is directly in his position (and his prior senate position) because of Peter Thiel who has directly dabbled with those ideas.

Musk is far simplier to explain. Prior to the election, Musk publicly said (i believe it was on Tucker Carlson) that if Donald Trump didn't win the election, he would be going to prison. And some may have thought he was saying that tongue in cheek but the first things that occurred were inspector generals were fired and then DOGE went after 11 agencies that had 32 pending investigations, pending complaints, or enforcement actions against Musk or one his six companies. 

What's really revealing about all of this is just how little the public understands about government and what is available publicly. There is already an audit of the Federal government by the Office of Management and Budget and the Federal Reserve (despite not being a federal entity) by the US Government Accountability Office (GAO). One done by people who actually understand what they’re looking at. It’s so weird how everyone makes this assumption that nothing in the government gets audited. Most of it does and is publicly available. Anyone who was remotely interested in the idea before could have searched for such things. One part where the federal government has never passed an audit (and the part of the government that pays all of Musk's businesses) is the Department of Defense. If DOGE was interested in finding wasteful spending, they should be looking there and in privatization - not in the civil government that is just carrying out what what Congress is appropriating.

Musk also has no experience doing an audit - which is why this whole thing reeks of corruption and a grift. Let alone that the ""evidence"" they've found shows the level of incompetence and lack of understanding of federal grants and contracts. For those who think Musk could still do an audit effectively despite his lack of expertise, it’s pretty much impossible for someone with his conflicts of interest to do an audit credibly. One of the most important things about an audit is that they are independent auditors without a financial interest in the outcome of the audit. Musk has conflicts of interest all over the place and has already proven that he lets them direct his ‘audit’ (such as shutting down USAID’s investigation of SpaceX).",480,2025-02-26 01:42:32,2025-02-26 03:52:42

I’m a never Trump Republican since April 2016 when I attended one of this man’s rallies. I have no idea how so many tens of millions of my fellow countrymen fail to see the hatred, anger, insecurity, narcissism and incompetence that define his character.

His one great talent is turning people against one another. He uses this skill relentlessly, identifying enemies to blame for every grievance, even those which are imagined fantasies.

Biden did a fine job as President. I’m not racing to put him on Mt Rushmore or anything, but he was downright decent. He ran a tight ship, he hired competent staff, he behaved as a President should. But he was a horrible messenger, and his decision to run for re-election was misguided. Democrats needed an open primary so that everybody’s voice could be heard and their issues could be addressed before unifying behind whatever flawed, imperfect person the Democrats nominated to lead the anti-Trump coalition.

That, combined with the absolute failure to prosecute those truly responsible for January 6th were his great mistakes.

In my opinion, when Biden took office, Trump was a defeated blip on the radar of US history. We were very strong, and his leadership made us stronger.

With Trump back in office, a lot of what Biden did at home and abroad will likely prove to be the temporal blip on the radar. Our future, and Biden’s legacy are in Trump’s weak and hateful hands.",805,2025-01-16 01:19:55,2025-01-16 01:33:13

",609,560,49,"I probably depends on how you define “stronger” and strongly on your political views.  But let’s see:   

Abroad:  
Objectively Russia is much weaker (though not as weak as we’d like) and has lost thousands of troops and hundreds of pieces of equipment including tanks, artillery, planes etc…. There’s an argument that if Russia takes Ukraine it will have been for nothing but that hasn’t happened yet.  

China is in a good place militarily but not economically. They have some financial problems domestically that is hurting their economy, but really nothing we’ve done has meaningfully changed China’s position in the last 4 years.   

North Korea: who knows, they’re probably the same…or maybe better since Russia is giving them stuff now.  

Iran: they’re way worse off. They lost their handle on Syria, Palestine, and their proxies in Yemen are getting wrecked. They’ve had political instability internally and have lost some key leaders.

At home:  

Objectively January of 2021 was not good. We were still in the depths of the Covid economic fallout and facing an ongoing pandemic that hadn’t quite subsided. Our economy by all measures is doing better than any other developed economy and despite inflation, has fared better than most other countries and appears to be nearly resolved. 

Other metrics: crime is down, employment is up.

Certainly there’s plenty of criticisms of Biden: he hasn’t done enough to support Ukraine, the Afghanistan withdrawal was a disaster, the Israel situation is a cluster, inflation remains a problem for most Americans and access to housing is a real problem. Not to mention we do not have a solution for migration and immigration.",105,2025-01-16 01:19:55,2025-01-16 01:47:02

I don't think Biden left a strong hand for Trump, he merely righted the ship, which is an achievement in its own right. I don't think anyone could have. The Republican party has surrendered itself to a circus, and the Democratic party has surrendered itself to their lobbyists. No one, especially young people, have any faith that this country is going to prepare for the future, THEIR future. The only thing I have to forward to is weathering the storm and hoping we don't take sink.

",609,560,49,"Hard to argue with a lot of that. Biden's legacy will be a hard one to pin down. Few Presidents have such an extreme mix of impressive highs and brutal lows.

Easily one of the most accomplished Presidents of the last fifty years. His team made legislative miracles happen with a 50/50 Senate and his economic performance on *traditional* metrics is among the best (and certainly not indicative of a one term President). He held the western powers together on Ukraine and had a handful of other foreign policy accomplishments.

Yet for all that; what he will probably be remembered most for was handing the Presidency back to trump and, if the worst case comes to pass, the last semblance of American democracy. 

The Afghanistan withdrawal was a disaster that he never really recovered from. His support for Ukraine was effective, but also very timid. And that hesitation cost Ukraine time and manpower. The 2021 winter Covid spike *somehow* caught his team completely off guard and further damaged his administration's credibility. And his team was simply horrible at messaging and communicating about the economy. Inflation was a global phenomenon; the housing crisis was the result of twenty years of near zero home construction and restrictive local zoning. Yet his team allowed both to define him without ever finding a decent rebuttal.

Biden was great at managing the legislative process 
for thirty-six years in the Senate; he was great at managing the legislative process as Obama's Vice President; and he was great at managing the legislative process as President.

Because that's what he is. A very effective legislator.

* Fighting between Israel and Palestine is at its deadliest in their shared history. Biden failed for over a year to mediate a ceasefire, and his role in it finally happening today is debatable given the timing.
* The Abraham Accords are effectively dead. All recent progress in normalizing relations between Israel and the Arab world have been undone.
* The Afghanistan withdrawal will go down as a major embarrassment for the US.

Conservatives feel that the world is getting away from them, and this is a real problem because in their POV the world has a natural order, it has a way its supposed to be, the change of the times and the culture is literally a bad thing. If there is a God who created all things, including just men and women, then anyone arguing in favor of change is arguing in favor of denying the divinely appointed order of the world. In their perspective change is evil, and those who seek it are at best deluded and foolish and at worst evil and conniving. In their view there is a way the world, and this nation, are supposed to be and that way has been perverted so they are justified in doing anything they can to put the world back to sorts (as they see it). 

They are taking advantage of a once in a lifetime opportunity to tear down the status quo, to shake up political norms, and to yank the Overton Window so far to the right that even if there is a free and fair election of a Democrat in four years it will be impossible to put the puzzle pieces back the way they were.

PoliticalDiscussion,controversial,Should firearm safety education be mandated in public schools?,1,0,1,"Class room time is a very limited commodity. If you add something to the curriculum you have to take other things away. Most Americans aren't gun owners nor do most Americans live in a house where there is a gun. For the average American student you would be taking away class time from some other important subject to teach them about guns which they will never own. The message ""don't play with guns"" and ""assume every gun is loaded"" is important but we don't need classrooms set aside to tell kids that. That kind of goes into the ""don't run with sharp objects"" and ""stop drop and role"" category. 

If a student is interested in joining the military or becoming a police officer they will typically receive firearm training there regardless of what is offered in schools. The US is also unlikely to face any homeland invasion which would require a ""total defense"" strategy would be needed. Personally I just don't see the benefit of adding gun safety classes as a requirement.

PoliticalDiscussion,controversial,Should firearm safety education be mandated in public schools?,1,0,1,"Judging from some other comments you made i realize you want a single firearm safety lecture to be mandatory, i still say that is a bad idea but i will list some reasons:

1) The political backlash won't be worth it. As a country we are so divided over guns it would just cause more political issues than it is worth.

2) To what purpose? A single lecture, even if it is a long one, will barely cover most topics and i don't know if you remember school lectures but at the end only about 10% of the kids will remember anything discussed. It isnt worth the cost or energy for it.

3) Who is doing the lecture? bringing in outside group? what group? do they have a bias? will there be a mandated curriculum? Are you going to get Texas and Vermont to agree to the same standards?

4) Most gun safety is common sense. If someone lacks common sense then no amount of training or lectures will help that situation.

A counter to your final sentence, talking about guns wont suddenly ""encourage"" rebellious thoughts in children. Modern children are surrounded by constant mass shootings and school shootings on the news, popular but violent videogames like call of duty, battlefield, and many others, as well as popular TV shows and movies that feature plenty of violence and gun fights. So in the end the lecture will be unlikely to accomplish anything except take away time children could be learning more useful things.",9,2025-01-14 23:47:34,2025-01-15 02:54:35

For the average kid all the instruction they need is something like ""If you see a gun lying around do not touch it, immediately tell a trusted adult"". Now that might need to be repeated a lot and periodically, but that's basically it. Teaching them how to handle a gun may encourage them to handle the gun, which is just increasing the chance of an accident.

PoliticalDiscussion,controversial,Should firearm safety education be mandated in public schools?,1,0,1,"I’m older than most of you and I can remember when everyone had access to guns. There were war surplus rifles in the sporting goods stores of every department store.
I don’t recall that we had mass shootings. There was always a group of people who thought there were too many guns around, but they were in the minority and not vocal.
This all changed after 1968, and I believe today’s youth are fascinated and obsessed with guns in a way that they weren’t when I was a kid. Maybe it’s due to social media or video games. 
I think it would be good for schools to have classes in the proper use of guns, so that guns are viewed as tools that are potentially lethal. Take the mystery out of guns and they’ll lose that sense of exciting, forbidden fruit that they didn’t have for me but seem to have for today’s youth.

I would include some of the unpleasant but necessary aspects of all firearms. Take the students to a range and fire off a round when they’re not wearing hearing protection. That’s a good way to introduce them to the destructive power of firearms.
Let them take apart a firearm and clean and lube it. It’s a dirty, unpleasant but necessary task.",2,2025-01-14 23:47:34,2025-01-15 16:24:46

\- Your mandate is defined by your boldness, your willingness to break the rules, and the strength of the opposition.

Trump and MAGA are bold AF, have no qualms about breaking any rules (or laws), and the opposition has no leg to stand on. Any in-party opposition (which other presidents had to deal with) has been neutered by MAGA in this case, so there are no guardrails.

PoliticalDiscussion,controversial,Why are right wing parties such as Germany's AfD and the US's Republican Party often described as antisemitic when they are staunchly pro-Israel?,0,0,0,"Ooohh this is gonna be a spicy one.

So there are a couple of elements at play here. I'm in the US so I can't speak 100% to the AFD, maybe someone more German can handle that.

Within the US context there's a couple of factors. One is that a lot of the Republican party is made up of Evangelical Christians and it's a huge component of Evangelical Christianity that there is a biblical prophecy that says that Israel has to rebuild the Temple of Solomon and possess all of the Holy Land and that will then go towards triggering the end times which means that Jesus returns. I get that this sounds bonkers but this is a big chunk of why so many Republicans support Israel.

Another component is that Israel is our only staunch ally in the region (I would personally argue that that's not true at all and that Israel is not an ally but that's for another thread) and a way for us to pursue our geopolitical interests in the region from a friendly position. It's geopolitically advantageous to the US to have Israel where it is and thus Republicans support it.

It's also not wild for antisemites to be very pro-Israel. The British were wildly antisemtic (some would argue still are) and one of the motivations for supporting the early Zionist movement was specifically so that British Jews would ""self deport"" to Israel. The idea is ""we can't kill them because people get upset but if we can just get them to go away, that's good enough."" 

Plus there's the factor of antisemties often also being anti-Arab/Muslim and seeing Israelis as bad but at least better than Arabs/Muslims and they want Israel as a way to fight against Muslims in the region.",21,2025-01-11 23:27:38,2025-01-12 02:48:28

Trump isn't a force of nature, and the executive brand taking more and more power isn't some sort of natural course of action.

Left wing and right wing presidents have respected the power that they have and worked within it. Most have pushed against it to try to get as much done as possible but respected when the courts or Congress said ""no"".  

There have been times in history when presidents didn't respect the courts, like Andrew Jackson did for at least one ruling and a few Congressional resolutions, mostly because he had a deep deep hatred for native Americans.

To hand wave what he's doing as inevitable is stupid. He didn't have to do this, he chose to do this, people choose to back him up. These are real people making these decisions. It's not the weather.

Trump is also not only doing things to hurt the left, he's hurting everyone with most of his orders. It's just only the left that is willing to fight it. It's a shame that people on the right think that makes it an attack on us.

It is bizarre that Western governments would ever recognize a state partly governed by an armed terrorist group, with a constitutional objective to commit Jewish genocide and fight western values abroad, that will also never hold democratic elections. You'd think they'd learn after 9/11 that helping an entity ideologically opposed to their existence won't end well for anyone.

Some Western governments made promises to placate their left wing political allies that make up an element of their governing coalition (Canada, for instance), or to rally flailing left wing / Muslim support (France has a fragile minority government).

Australia is an exception. They don't even have conditions. They are just taking Abbas at his word, and none of his promises for the Palestinian Territories (both Gaza and West Bank) will come to pass save one (ending pay to slay payments): 

> major new commitments from the Palestinian Authority, including to reform governance, terminate prisoner payments, institute schooling reform, demilitarise and hold general elections.

...I love how the pay for slaying Jews policy is renamed prisoner payments.

The UK and others may have inadvertently encouraged the latest military offensive by Israel by putting the IDF on the clock, and by also discouraging Hamas from coming to an agreement with Israel because now Hamas believes international pressure has made time their ally.

PoliticalDiscussion,controversial,Is Border Security and Legal Immigration Reform the Key to Fixing America's Immigration Crisis?,0,0,0,"First, it's important to recognize that border security and immigration are two distinct issues. Although they are often conflated in today's media, they are not related.

The immigration system itself operates smoothly, with millions of people legally entering the country each year. However, border security is about preventing unauthorized entry and protecting the nation’s borders, not about managing immigration. Yes, many people arrive at the border daily, but that does not constitute immigration.

Immigration is a legal, documented process where individuals are granted permission to enter the country ""before"" doing so. If you show up at the border, you are required to go through a designated port of entry and present your documentation to see if you are allowed to enter. Anyone who bypasses this process is breaking the law and faces immediate deportation or even possibly jail time before being deported.

To illustrate, imagine returning home to find a family living in your house. They think your home is better than theirs, they can't afford their own, or think you just have better food and beds. Would you let them stay, feed, and clothe them like part of your family, or would you call the police and have them removed for squatting?

While the moral complexities of those arriving at the border are important, many are fleeing persecution and seeking asylum, this process must be properly verified. Additionally, international asylum protocols require that asylum seekers file their claims for asylum in the first country they enter, rather than passing through multiple countries to reach their preferred destination. By traveling through other nations to get to the U.S. they are violating these international protocols. Meaning they have violated asylum protocols and we should not be grant them asylum.

Trump however has been stoking fears by having masked agents (at times not even law enforcement) snatching people off the streets and stoking fear that created the environment for this, he additionally uses language that has been dehumanizing and sanctioning violence.

PoliticalDiscussion,controversial,Who is accountable for the 2025 LA riots—or are several parties responsible for the situation?,0,0,0,"Just like with everything else, there is a multiple, fundamental, misunderstandings about the political climate in this country. 

Liberals, which include the majority of Democrats, are not protesting. Democrats are traditionally pro-deportation of undocumented immigrants with criminal records. The #s of deportations that occurred under Clinton, Obama, and Biden back that up. Democrats are also not passionate enough to warrant taking to the streets. 

The reason that people are upset with this administration regarding immigration is twofold: 

1. The people being arrested and deported are seemingly not receiving due process. For all we know, they are deporting a lot of innocent people. The Constitution is crystal clear and has been confirmed by SCOTUS that ALL PEOPLE, not just citizens, are entitled to due process under the 4th and 14th amendments. There would be no protests if we were sure that each of these people got their day in court with proper representation. 
2. Deporting people still doesn't fix the immigration issue. It is simply treating the symptoms instead of the root cause. Congress needs to pass comprehensive immigration reform that directly addresses the main issues. Biden (regardless if you like him or not), was clear that he would sign a bill after it passes Congress.",57,2025-06-10 19:27:14,2025-06-10 19:38:02

You have your answer and your reasons in your first sentence. 

There are a couple of goals for this and it has been self evident for a while that this is what the GOP\* wants to do. 

* Firehose of falsehood - just throw as much shit as possible around and see what sticks. 
   * It doesn't really matter what hits the news and what doesn't the goal is to flood the zone so that no one story gets traction, there's always a new story to distract and obfuscate what's really going on. 
      * Notice that Trump's budget bill doesn't get headlines?
      * How about the obvious corruption of this administration?
      * DOGE isn't in the headlines
      * Where's Musk?
      * Gaza ethnic cleansing?
      * Diversion of resources from Ukraine?
* The ICE raids, arrests and deportations are blatant violations of constitutional protections and due process.  They are deliberately inflammatory. He's just waiting for one city to do this. Could have been Chicago, Seattle, or NYC. Doesn't matter, but bonus points for CA. 
* Use military to quell ""civil unrest"" - again blatantly illegal with a few very narrow exceptions.
   * Where's the logistical support for the Guard and Marines? - that's all you need to know about what really matters - making headlines on Fox.
* Remember the Portland protests during his last term? That was about 2 blocks. But Fox wanted to you think that it was the entire city that burned to the ground. 
   * [Michael Reinoehl](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1GCCA_enUS1097US1097&cs=0&sca_esv=ea7b27f3c7f5bbf6&sxsrf=AE3TifPWAPjnITnwOrr_ylmbYOFRPEZL8g%3A1749584406345&q=Michael+Reinoehl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjE9IjozeeNAxU3hYkEHXn6Ep8QxccNegQIAhAD&mstk=AUtExfCSUK2iUr1JZbq-0uBoaos7ckFxGcL3M0tp4GPedNm7TtWnwVCf7M0S1rmwEqxve4EUvAwDFrB39jBg9l9jPS-6zW2zcsbMhhYpGxG02Dv0Akj0-i4lMd8Rz1hyu4ImxCqMJt6H51sKsaazB2zK9OZjzdKUHW-oGdG8GQtPo2O75cY&csui=3) was murdered by police - that got buried. 

The long term goal by the GOP is to ever expand the power and wealth of the 0.1% and to  entrench GOP politicians. That is their only real goal. These escalations provide a distraction, and a pretext, for that.

For example, bringing up hate speech concerning Charlie Kirk is misleading and inaccurate. 

Hate speech is directed at classes of people without regard for their personhood and individuality. Hate speech can target gays, blacks, women, could target men or whites too—whole classes of people being threatened by generally directed hate. An obvious precursor to violent persecution.

Charlie Kirk is an individual and as a public figure is an appropriate target for political and personal opinions. While it is appropriate to condemn political violence, commentators can also welcome the loss of Charlie Kirk without engaging in hate speech.

Condemning an individual for their speech and actions is not hate speech, it’s personal judgment. We can be judged in turn on whether we are right or wrong, but we are not engaging in hate speech by judging a person is villainous due to broadly offensive behavior.",4,2025-09-17 18:10:50,2025-09-17 20:03:14

Idk why you democrats are so dense. It's basic human psychology to be seen and heard. Y'all are so stupid sometimes....

Just a little something for young men to let them know ""Boys, we hear you. We understand that there's a lot going on in our lives and we need some help. We will make sure you get the support and help you need.

PoliticalDiscussion,controversial,Are you more authoritarian or libertarian on immigration?,14,7,7,"It depends on the privileges that citizens/immigrants enjoy.

In socially-progressive countries like in Europe, immigration is notoriously difficult, because there’s no way you can offer free healthcare and retirement benefits to everyone who wants it by nature of an easy immigration system.

Countries like Canada have a bit of a tiered immigration system. It’s hard to immigrate, unless you’re a fairly well-off student or professional worker who can pay to get work authorization, and don’t need government subsidies. It’s a very different paradigm than in the US where many low-income people are crossing the border.

I’m of the belief that if any rich country, such as the US, had a libertarian immigration system then it would absolutely be abused to the point of failure by anyone looking to come there for work. Every country has the right and duty to allow immigrants in a manner that benefits the country and doesn’t overwhelm its resources.",26,2025-04-14 03:13:03,2025-04-14 03:48:47
PoliticalDiscussion,controversial,Are you more authoritarian or libertarian on immigration?,14,7,7,"More in the direction of legalistic. I don’t like the inherent value-laden language you use. 

Immigrants here for labor should pay taxes, though probably at a lower rate as they don’t enjoy full use of state services. We should take better care to ensure student and worker visas do not discourage companies/schools from taking on citizens or incentivize depressing wages for locals. Worker visas should go to the far ends of employment: work that it’s hard to find people with the right skillset, or work that citizens don’t want to do. 

There should be much stricter enforcement against businesses hiring illegal workers, and apartments renting to them. Owners and landlords should themselves be fined and charged for breaking migration law. Policy should be changed to require that a potential refugee stay and gain asylum in the first safe country, not use asylum in order to economically migrate. 

For people who would be citizens in the West, they need to demonstrate appreciation for western values. This includes tolerance of people of different sex, race and religion, not mistreating people on the basis of their sex, embracing freedom of speech, and, because the Paradox of Tolerance is a thing, people who oppose the West, or practice some form of religious or cultural practice incompatible with western values, should not be allowed.

Migration and granting citizenship is a privilege, not a right. At least in the West, there are literally billions who would like to be here. We should be more discerning on who we place in the front of the line. Absolutely we should take in people from the global south, who are worse off, in many cases from the excesses of actions in previous centuries. But we live as if in a lifeboat, and citizens will not tolerate taking on more migrants that they feel they can handle, or voters will move in a rightward direction, which helps neither migrants nor the nation, often. So, a country does best on migration policy when it uses law and law enforcement to ensure migrants are either legitimately refugees, or are coming in to bring real benefit to the nation, and in either case that they will preferably integrate to the local norms and culture, or at a minimum are not hostile to the same.",10,2025-04-14 03:13:03,2025-04-14 03:40:00

PoliticalDiscussion,controversial,How will the increasing diversity in the Republican voter base impact its future?,9,4,5,"I think that ""diversity"" isn't really the word to use for the GOP. They have picked up more skin tnes, but it's almost impossible to find a college graduate in the party anymore. The last time I looked, the biggest statistical predictor of if you're a Trump supporter anymore is level of education - the less you have, the more likely you are to support him (and it really is his party now). Anyone who knows anything about science, or medicine, or economics, or history, or really anything has run screaming from the party. They have opposed education on pretty much every level for decades, and they are reaping the ""rewards"". Sure, it's destroying the nation, but whatever. This is pretty much always the go-to move for any authoritarian movement because the less you know, the more easily you are played. And now they've finally reached the point where they can openly move to completely eliminate the Dept of Education. Now the red states, which already generally have terrible schools, in large part because they also tend to be the poor states, would now not get any federal money, thus making their population even more poorly educated, and consequently even more easily manipulated. 

This is going to be horrific. 

So, again, I think the whole ""diversity"" thing is overplayed. Things come down to policies. The less knowledge you have, the more likely you are to be convinced to vote for policies which tend to be bad for the common man.

PoliticalDiscussion,controversial,How should conservatives decide between conflicting traditions?,0,0,0,"The fundamental question is: should the government be used as a tool to help the people? Or should the people be responsible for themselves without government help?

Should the government collect taxes, and then use them on a national level to improve the lives of all the citizens? That is the liberal view. This leads to national parks, national health standards, national infrastructure, a central government that is used for the benefit of all citizens. I think of this as the Christian view: the meek shall inherit the earth, feed the poor, what you have done to the least of us you have done to all of us; we are all in this together.

The conservative view is that people are responsible for themselves, there should be no national ""nanny"" government. People rise to their level based on their own efforts, their own talents. This leads to no national infrastructure, no taxing of some in order to help others. This was made explicit with the Confederacy: only state level infrastructure, no national conscription for national armies, no central government at the national level to look after the welfare of all citizens. This is the Old Testament view: the strong shall rule over the weak, the rich don't pay taxes to feed the poor.

Today, the conservatives are trying to dismantle the American government; disband the Post Office, disband the Dept of Education and FEMA and let the states handle it. Sell nationally owned land to the states or private interests. Privatize Social Security, the government collecting taxes and then disbursing it to all citizens is a liberal concept, conservatives call it communism and want to abolish it. The central government should not be in the business of running things.

So is it going to be the Old Testament way of ""an eye for an eye"", or should that tradition be replaced with ""turn the other cheek and love your enemies""? Should the strong rule the weak or should the meek and humble inherit the earth? Do you help the stranger or turn him away? Are all people equal and deserve equal treatment, or do some deserve special treatment and position based on their personal situation?

It was the conservatives who tried to destroy the United States so they could keep their slaves.

PoliticalDiscussion,controversial,How should conservatives decide between conflicting traditions?,0,0,0,"Your question is a reasonable one from an ivory tower point of view, but not well grounded in the current movement.  Right wing parties throughout the world, but most well covered in America are currently United by a rejection of conservatism.

So in short, your question is as timely as the proper etticut of two horse-drawn carriages meeting at an intersection.  

To tackle the ivory tower question: conservativism should be inclined to preserve traditions, but not fully bound by them.  It is, in theory a pragmatic philosophy.  Take time to evaluate changes before making them, and make them intentionally based on a desired outcome.  Typically the desired outcome has been articulated as economic growth, but it could also be more or less wealth inequality or greatest happiness or any number of other goals. 

As outlined above you can see how this is directly in opposition to the ""move fast and break things"" philosophy endorsed by many right wing parties.

But how should conservatives decide between competitions traditions?


The more you think like this, the less conservative you become. 

A lot of modern American conservative thought is “because I said so”. Imagine the GOP as a boomer parent talking to a young teen. 

“Why do tax cuts for the rich help the middle class?” 

“Because I said so.”

“How do we know climate change isn’t real, and that our actions affect it?”

“Because I said so.”

“Why is the COVID vaccine more harmful than it is helpful?”

“Because I said so.”

Each of these things can be easily disproven. When people start to think about their beliefs, they start to research, and begin to get a clearer picture of how the world really works. I’m not saying the left is always right- *they’re not.* 

What I’m saying is that a lot of the backbone thoughts in American conservatism are not realistic. It’s no coincidence that conspiracy theories run rampant on the right. Life experience and education (whether self or otherwise), shows that a lot of this stuff just isn’t realistic.",3,2025-02-19 06:36:56,2025-02-19 14:34:00
PoliticalDiscussion,controversial,How should conservatives decide between conflicting traditions?,0,0,0,"American conservatism is dead. It died during Trump's first term.

Modern American conservatism started in 1980 with Ronald Reagan and ended in 2016 following Trump's victory. This brand of conservatism had a few core ideas such as:

* Being fiscally conservative

* Pro-business/anti-unions

* Deregulation and tax cuts benefit the American economy

* America is a power for good in the world and it's hegemony must be maintained

* America must project power to protect American interests and values around the world

* America is an exceptional country whose history, ideals, and traditions must be 
cherished and preserved

* Christian values (especially on social issues) should be secularized and turned into law

There's more to it, but you get the gist. This brand of conservatism was seen as something very rational, and the people who supported it saw themselves as the ""adults"" in the room. The narrative was that as people aged and got more experienced and wisdom, they would come to realize that conservatism was ultimately right.

This type of conservatism no longer exists. The last presidential candidate to be a true conservative was Mitt Romney in 2012. Around 2015/2016 these conservatives made a bet on Trump, thinking that he would represent their beliefs... but they ended up being wrong.

Trump in his first term made it very apparent that he was not a conservative nor did he care about conservatism. He didn't care about business, America's role in the world, the constitution, Christian values, balancing the budget, or anything conservatism believed in. A lot of them quickly figured out that Trump is a threat to their brand of politics and started opposing him, however, this resulted in Trump labeling them as RINOs and subsequently purging them from the Republican party.

As Trump slowly but surely squeezed the legacy conservatives out of the GOP, he replaced them with MAGA loyalists. Unlike the conservatives who had principles and values that they believed in, MAGA had nothing. They believed in nothing and they stood for nothing. They only exist to appease Trump. What was left of the GOP, both the base and the politicians, were opportunists who sucked up Trump to advance their political careers/interests and MAGA loyalists who will follow Trump no matter what.

The legacy conservatives became politically homeless, and their squeeze was finalized in 2021 when Mike Pence in his last days in office, took a stand against Trump to protect the country from his attempted coup. Pence's defiance by choosing the country and his prinicples over Trump, was the final nail in the coffin. It was guaranteed at that point, that if Trump ever got back into the white house, he will exclusively only select diehard loyalists to appoint or back for anything... which is where we are now.

Which bring us to today. What do conservatives today stand for? Nobody knows. Why? It's because they stand for nothing. American conservatism today is literally just the whims of a senile 78 year old Trump. His words and actions define conservatism no matter how wrong, how irrational, how obscene, or how contradictory they are. Since MAGA are blindly faithful, American conservatism today acts like a religion but without any substance. In other words, a cult. 

The sliver lining here is this, there will be no MAGA controlled GOP post Trump. Since MAGA's one and only central belief is following Trump no matter what, it will live and die with Trump. At the same time, conservatism from the Reagan Era is officially dead and will never come back. What this means is that either in 2028 or whenever Trump dies, we will have a new brand of American conservatism. Since the Democrats are going through a similar transformation right now, that means we're about to enter a new era of American politics in a few years.",6,2025-02-19 06:36:56,2025-02-19 12:00:06

I obviously wasn’t around during Lincoln’s time, but his impact is still everywhere today. If we’re talking more recent leaders, FDR is another strong pick. He got the U.S. through the Great Depression and World War II, and his New Deal policies changed the way the government helps people.

PoliticalDiscussion,controversial,Do you think we can overcome political bias?,0,0,0,"*Partisanship—the strong allegiance to a specific political party or ideology—has been one of the biggest challenges to progress in modern America.*

I think that's a pretty shallow bit of political analysis. It's simultaneously true while being almost completely unhelpful. The problem isn't *that* we're divided, it's what we're divided *about*. And the main problem is that most people don't clearly understand what the division is. Which prevents us from talking about it, let alone resolving it.

In a nutshell, one side of American politics has formed around a decades-long backlash against the progress made by blacks and women in the 1960s and 70s. The modern Republican Party has since that time been against just about every policy that might benefit average Americans...because now it includes them. And a large swath of white America decided to drain the pool and fill it in permanently rather than swim with their black neighbors. (H/T Heather McGhee) This is the reason why we don't have nice things like healthcare and livable wages and all the rest of the things other wealthy democracies seem to have.

Trump is just the last gasp of people tired of seeing their preferred social order eroded decade after decade. Specifically, white supremacy and misogyny and homophobia. MAGA is nothing more than a desire to return to a time when straight white men controlled everything, women and people of color knew their places, and the LGBTQ folks were invisible.

And some of us want this so badly that we're willing to cast aside democracy itself in order to achieve it.

We don't need to reduce partisanship. We have to confront the division for what it is, and decide things one way or the other permanently.",4,2025-01-27 00:28:44,2025-01-27 21:07:26
PoliticalDiscussion,controversial,Do you think we can overcome political bias?,0,0,0,"It is not partisanship that creates the ""us vs them"" nature of politics. Conflict over values, interests, and resources does that. Strong allegiance to a party/ideology does not preclude seeking common ground. Consider the era from 1963-1973. 

1) There was intense ""us against them"" thinking during that decade on race relations. And yet our government passed the Civil Rights Act, the Fair Housing Act, and the Voting Rights Act. 

2) There was intense partisanship in the elections that brought Nixon to power. And yet it was bi-partisan Senate Committee that unearthed the truth about his involvement in the Watergate coverup. 

3) There was intense partisanship over environmental degradation. And yet our government created the EPA, and passed the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act with bipartisan support.

By contrast, in the post-Obama era, the government has been unable to respond effectively to conflicts over race relations, election corruption, or the climate crisis.  Instead, we are a “house divided against itself”. Democrats and Republicans actually dislike members the opposing party. Each group tends to live near, and interact with, like-minded people who get their information from the same sources. It has become easier for members of each party to demonize and stereotype the other and harder for them to share resources or power.

It is more than just intolerance of the other side’s ideas. It is the dissolution of the commitments by which Americans have forged themselves into a single nation. Democratic politics is possible only when citizens agree that their disagreements are bound by a common fate.

PoliticalDiscussion,controversial,Did the Democratic Party create Trumpism by shutting out its own reformers?,0,0,0,"Bernie Sanders lost the popular vote in the 2016 and 2020 Democratic primaries by landslide margins.

Given that primary voters tend to be further from the center than the median voter, that would suggest that he would have performed even worse in a general election.

The Democratic party is a big tent.  (Given their demographics, the Republicans don't need to be.)

About half of that Democratic tent is moderate to conservative.  Many among them are non-white, working class and socially moderate to conservative.

Most of the other half is establishment liberal, not populist.

Dems win when they have a leader who can unify the liberal and moderate/conservative blocs.

Given the diversity of those groups, that requires charisma.

Few people are charismatic.  Bill Clinton and Obama were both highly charismatic politicians.  

Biden had a bit of it in 2020, playing the role of kindly, stable uncle (albeit gaffe prone), although he lost it fairly quickly once elected.

Bernie Sanders is a crank and a curmudgeon.  He will be highly appealing to enough people that he can come in second place.  He will never win a presidential election.

Unlike her husband, Hillary Clinton is almost anti-charismatic.  Kamala Harris is not much better.

If the Dems are going to allow their branding decisions to be made by scolds who don't appreciate the needs of a big tent and a charismatic unifying figure, then they will keep losing.  So far, they seem determined to lose.

They also need to keep the left from burning down the tent.  Bill Clinton used the Sister Souljah moment to push back the left activists and brand the party as his rather than theirs.  Dems who fail to prevent the left from hijacking the brand will pay dearly for it.

Today's Democrats lack the fortitude to do what Bill Clinton did, even though the rebranding is more important than ever.",15,2025-06-08 07:46:56,2025-06-08 15:41:59

PoliticalDiscussion,controversial,Will U.S. presidents have trouble getting reelected going forward due to distrust of incumbents?,1,0,1,"I don't think it is that black and white. I think we were in a unique situation because of COVID bleeding into inflation, so things have been considered bad for a long time. And I can remember even pre-COVID I heard many people talking about delaying major purchases because it felt like a recession was coming. When it feels like things have been bad for as long as you can remember, voters want change. 

While I'm not giving Biden a pass on any responsibility for inflation, he was simply incapable of defending his own record. There was a decent story to tell for a skilled speaker (soft landing, compare U.S. to other 1st world countries, etc.), but that person wasn't Biden. If an incumbent wants another chance when things are bad, they need to convince us exactly why they deserve it. Biden (and later Kamala) basically said 'I'm gonna give you 4 more years of the same'. That's the opposite of what voters wanted to hear.

Bob Casey (D-PA) was another good example of an incumbent being pushed out. He had very little to say while campaigning that wasn't 'I support Biden' and 'look at my past record'. That's not what voters want to hear when things are bad and have been bad for a long time. I think that is especially true in a purple state like PA. You can't count on a majority who are going to vote blue or red regardless. Though out-of-state millionaire Dave McCormick was such a bad candidate that I still thought Casey would narrowly win, like how recent stroke victim Fetterman previously beat Dr. Oz. But Casey also got zero help from the top of the ticket.

But when things are going good, I don't see why a future incumbent wouldn't still be re-elected, even if they didn't directly contribute to the good times. Sometimes it's the luck of the draw. You could be a terrible candidate, but running when your party holds the White House and a majority in Congress during a good time for the country.

PoliticalDiscussion,controversial,Why don't people in countries like iran or russia take up arms and engage in guerrilla warfare like in myanmar?,0,0,0,"Man, my simple answer regarding Russia is this: it's the North, dude!  
Life is tough and short for the homeless here. Try to understand, or  
come visit. Temperatures are usually below freezing, with knee-deep snow  
from November to March. (This year, by the way, there’s almost no snow  
and it’s much warmer — hello to climate skeptics!) So, the thing is,  
life here has always only been possible through close ties and  
dependence on society and the state. 

Do you get what I mean? 

The state  
builds roads, the state maintains them, the state decides whether you’ll  
have gas heating in your house or if you’ll be heating with firewood.  
And even at the level of local officials, the state decides which stores  
you’ll shop at, not to mention schools for kids. And so — you weren’t  
born in the forest but within a cell of society. The state shaped your  
worldview through 100% mandatory schooling and through a bunch of  
government TV channels that are free and turned on by default, covering  
all basic informational and entertainment needs. 

Who’s gonna head out into some frozen forest to start a guerrilla campaign? 

In civilization, you have everything you’re used to for living, even formally free  
healthcare, which admittedly treats worse and worse, but at least any  
treatment is relatively fast and free! 

So all the country's resources flow into Putin’s hands in Moscow; all key enterprises across all sectors of economics are controlled by those close to Putin. 

So what? With what money  
are you going to make a revolution?",1,2025-03-16 18:49:16,2025-03-17 08:27:57

PoliticalDiscussion,controversial,What does government do well and what does government not do well?,7,3,4,"I'll take a swing at this.

My pops passed away when I was in the 8th grade and Social Security Insurance ensured that me, my sister, and immigrant mother had a shot in this world. It was definitely more than my dad paid in and it saved our family even though he had decent life insurance. The same benefit that Paul Ryan benefitted from and wanted to remove from everyone else, btw, because he was rich enough that it was extra money to them. The government kept its promise to my father by ensuring his family always had some form of resources until we turned 18.

I had a pretty bad stuttering problem when very young and the special classes I got to attend through the public school system. I was then able to communicate with my classmates better which improved my grades which led to actual academic achievement and success. The government fulfilled its obligation to provide a safe learning environment and even let me play sports on its dime, as well. Anecdotal, but it appears that on a mass scale the government is largely delivering on this promise. We're not pumping out geniuses, but that's not the mission. We rate well, on average, with our world peers.

During my time in the Navy I was taught how to operate a nuclear reactor by a group with zero incidents since being bestowed the responsibility of operating and maintaining nuclear power plants above and below the surface of the water. Imagine an organization that has been training 18 year olds from all levels of education to safely qualify to stand watch over literally the power center of one of the largest nuclear arsenals or air wings in the world.

This government has maintained the USA as the cultural power center of the world for many decades. It has lost its luster, especially amongst peers, but few countries represent a positivity that radiates beyond the slimy sheen. This is not just because of the Hollywood and its reach, our products get everywhere because our government opens and maintains these channels.

I will freely state this government sucks in a ton of ways and as a small business owner I assure you the suck is extended to that world, as well. It's just that the alternative is businesses and the rich getting away with whatever they want and I'm not down with that. Government should fill the gaps of services not provided by the commercial markets and society's protections against the whims of the rich.",34,2025-03-07 20:26:34,2025-03-07 23:14:40

PoliticalDiscussion,controversial,What does government do well and what does government not do well?,7,3,4,"Government is like a hammer. You can build wonderful things with it… or you can bash in skulls. It’s less about the concept of government and more about who is driving it.

Ultimately, I believe any form of government works… in theory (except those based on subjugation, slavery, racism, sexism, etc.). The problem each form of government has is that *people are involved*. A king can be an amazing ruler that is adored by the people, but he can also be cruel. It’s all about the person.

Ultimately, eventually, someone bad will come along. The benefit of a unitary executive is they can fix things fast… but they can also corrupt things fast. If you decentralize, then things change slower; it’s slower to fix things, but it’s also slower to corrupt.

I think America is seeing the whiplash of going from decades of gridlock as a decentralized government to the speed of a unitary executive. That particular individual, in my opinion, is not a good person, so it has some devastating ramifications.

Ask_Politics,hot,Is it possible to use a 14th Amendment Interstate Compact to avoid a debt ceiling standoff?,1,1,0,"Almost certainly not for a few reasons.

First off, many states don't have mass fiscal resources due to having lower taxes and obligations. Some states *do* have multi-billion dollar budgets, but that money also comes from the federal government in part via block grant programs. Therefore, asking states to pay the massive 880 billion in interest upkeep with relatively meager budgets that would be impacted by a shutdown is infeasible.

Additionally, this would likely be an extremely hard sell to the states that generally pay more in than they receive from the federal government. [At least using 2023 figures](https://usafacts.org/articles/which-states-contribute-the-most-and-least-to-federal-revenue/), Florida, Texas, New York, New Jersey, California, Illinois, and Ohio all would likely balk at the government they net-contribute relying on them to contribute *more* to deal with the debt that *they* racked up. 

Finally, there's a good chance this is unconstitutional. Article 1 Section 8 clearly states ""The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts... of the United States,"" which carries a strong implication that the states would not have the power to pay the Debts of the United States. The 10th Amendment seems to support this, as ""The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people"" would likely be interpreted to mean that, due to the United States Congress having sole financial power in the U.S. government, an interstate compact to pay the debts of the United States would be unconstitutional.

So, due to a lack of resources, political will, and constitutional viability, it's almost certainly impossible. Very interesting idea though!",1,2025-06-22 22:20:47,2025-09-24 15:25:04

Ask_Politics,hot,Why was NYC always heavily democrat?,13,12,1,"The story that Democrats and Republicans ""switched"" positions sometime in the 30s is an oversimplification. Democrats and Republicans were big-tent parties with Progressive and Conservative factions. Republicans, after the Civil War, while taking the ""left"" stance on Reconstruction and Civil Rights,  very quickly became associated with Northern Business interests. Democrats took the mantle of ""populism."" 

The Progressive movement within both the Republican and Democratic parties vied for the vote of the urban working class, while Democrats increasingly embraced the populist concerns of midwestern farmers (along with their white southern base). The Democrats also developed close ties to""white ethnics,"" Jewish, Irish, Italian, and, to a lesser extent, Germans. This coalition,  white ethnics,  some portion of the working class, and anyone annoyed with whoever the Republican president was quickly became a majority in NYC

People also voted for more based on the relationships they had with local politicians and the Tammany Hall Society, which ran NYC politics for about a hundred years from around the 1860s to the 1940s and was close with the Democratic party

Ask_Politics,hot,Why was NYC always heavily democrat?,13,12,1,"NYC’s been heavily Democratic since the 1800s due to its diverse, working-class immigrant population, strong labor unions, and urban reliance on public services. Tammany Hall used to buy votes, back in the good old days... The shirt waist factory fire roused people AND showed them that they had power.  Democrats built loyalty through aid and policies like the New Deal, while the city’s liberal, educated vibe keeps it blue. GOP wins (like Giuliani) are rare and usually moderate. Dems outnumber Republicans 6 to 1 today.

In-depth analysis and background on a topic, cutting out all of the ‘crazy’ [no offence intended]  

I found both incredibly valuable, since the Australian public broadcaster has no as and is taxpayer funded:    Means they don’t need hyperbole and aren’t beholden to corporate interests.   
The whole prob of attracting or ticking off advertisers doesn’t arise.   

Both are a lot more down to earth than most free U.S. outlets:   I’ve found YouTube vids to have super-hyperbolic titles ….. and then I wasted like half an hour watching something that was fairly uninformed I’ve and underwhelming. 😢 

Maybe have a look at the two shows below, see if either might be helpful:

Ask_Politics,hot,Why Did the Democrats Unanimously Confirm Marco Rubio?,10,10,0,"On a broader level, confirmation is not meant to be about agreeing with candidates on everything - but about vetting to see if they would be viable, competent, and fit for the job.

(And I say this as a Floridian and a Democrat who finds Rubio to be the most spineless excuse for someone who loves to claim he's on moral high ground) By that measure, Rubio isn't a particularly controversial pick. He's been in the Senate for 14 years, and in the Florida House before that. He's sat as both [Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee and as a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs.](https://www.congress.gov/member/marco-rubio/R000595)

On a political level, you have to choose your battles - while sure maybe it didn't have to be unanimous, politicians need to face the reality of the situation on how many nominations they can realistically fight and how many they can even oppose if they pass. And in this case, Democrats likely feel they need to conserve their political capital to fight what they see as the most egregious nominations of unqualified and/or radical nominations. Rubio is neither of those - again, saying that as someone who really dislikes him (even moreso now seeing what his spinelessness is leading him to advocate for (including on closing refugee admissions - by which his own family arrived to this country - and on the admin's opposition to birthright citizenship - by which he himself is a citizen of the United States since neither of his parents were citizens yet when he was born)",8,2025-02-03 20:31:56,2025-02-08 07:13:42

CBP collects tariffs as goods enter the United States. The company exporting that goods pays the fee, but they pay it by increasing the costs of their goods by a corresponding amount. So, they charge 25% more, and CBP collects that money from them when the food enters a port of entry.

Tariffs are basically a tax on the consumer. You are paying the company more, who then pays CBP.

She doesn't seem to really like or be comfortable in public so she might stick to just politicking, especially since she's always been a career politician and is relatively young. Some were saying she might be doing a comeback and go for another run in 2028 but this really depends on if there's seriously no other contenders in the Democrat party in 4 years.

She might go for Gavin Newsom's Governor seat when it's up in 2026, she might try to get back into the Senate when there's vacancies.

Some quotes:

**American voters are less ideologically polarized than they think they are, and that misperception is greatest for the most politically engaged people**. 

However, most partisans hold major misbeliefs about the other party’s preferences that lead them to think there is far less shared policy belief. This perception gap is highest among progressive activists, followed closely by extreme conservatives: in other words, the people who are most involved in civic and political life hold the least accurate views of the other side’s beliefs. Figure 1 shows the gap between what groups of Americans think the other side believes and what they self-report believing, as of 2019.

**American politicians are highly ideologically polarized. In other words, they believe in and vote for different sets of policies, with little overlap. This trend has grown in a steady, unpunctuated manner for decades.** 

One reason that the most highly politically engaged Americans may misunderstand the other side is that they correctly estimate the extreme ideological polarization among politicians. 

While at this point, candidates and parties may be responding to polarized primary voters, candidates and parties have been driving the polarization, and not all voters are ideologically polarized. 

The disparity between where leaders are ideologically and where their voters are precludes legislative policy agreement on many issues. Average voters are not able to assert their (often weak) policy preferences because they do not have an effective way to vote out representatives who do not accurately represent their constituents’ views, particularly on the right where party chairs are likely to substitute one extreme candidate for another.

**Even though Americans are not as ideologically polarized as they believe themselves to be, they** ***are*** **emotionally polarized (known as “affective polarization”). In other words, they do not like members of the other party.** 

Americans harbor strong dislike for members of the other party (though they also dislike their own parties, as well). While social media is often blamed for this phenomenon, affective polarization started growing before the internet: its onset more closely correlates with the rise of cable news and radio talk shows.

**Similarly, affective polarization is not causing political violence directly. It is probably contributing to an environment that allows politicians and opinion leaders to increase violence targeted at politicians, election officials, women, and many types of minorities.** 

Affective polarization in the United States has been rising for decades, while political violence only increased sharply in 2016. Affective polarization is also quite symmetrical across parties, while political violence is overwhelmingly from the right. This suggests that emotional feelings of hatred toward members of the other party are not a primary cause of political violence. ",15,2025-01-05 06:03:44,2025-01-05 22:47:14

Ask_Politics,top,What happens to Kamala after Trump takes office?,28,27,1,"I think ex-presidents get their salary for life, not to mention secret service detail. The rules are similar for vice-presidents. They also get retirement pensions based on years of service and the VP counts as a senate member, based on their role as president of the Senate (having tie-breaking vote, essentially).

Short answer, Kamala Harris will be just fine even if she never works again. 

This isn’t the best source, but it came up quickly on google and it’s easy enough to read.

Ask_Politics,top,What happens to Kamala after Trump takes office?,28,27,1,"As usual, she will either go for other ""smaller"" positions or will transition into being more of a public figure and do speeches and book deals. I don't really know how much interest there is in her compared to people like Obama/Clinton though, so not sure about the latter. She's already announced a book:

[https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/kamala-harris/kamala-harris-potential-book-rcna187755](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/kamala-harris/kamala-harris-potential-book-rcna187755)

She doesn't seem to really like or be comfortable in public so she might stick to just politicking, especially since she's always been a career politician and is relatively young. Some were saying she might be doing a comeback and go for another run in 2028 but this really depends on if there's seriously no other contenders in the Democrat party in 4 years.

She might go for Gavin Newsom's Governor seat when it's up in 2026, she might try to get back into the Senate when there's vacancies. Some have even mentioned her as a potential Supreme Court candidate but people have pretty much suggested everyone for the Supreme Court. It would be kinda on brand for her considering her legal work.",5,2025-01-13 13:06:20,2025-01-16 11:05:17

Ask_Politics,top,What happens to Kamala after Trump takes office?,28,27,1,"Technically former Presidents get a 'salary for life' that's actually a pension payment - but a pension set up to effectively pay them the equivalent of a Cabinet secretary for life. 

The VP is not entitled to that but is entitled to a Senate pension based on their years of service, as you mentioned, in their capacity as a Senate President but actually does not receive one in their capacity as Vice President. 

Realistically, she would've been fine anyway though it doesn't hurt. Her husband is a successful lawyer in his own right. And she can frankly easily ship out books that people will buy and read.",4,2025-01-13 13:06:20,2025-01-15 21:36:31

Best bet would probably be finding two good news sources - the Economist is a good place to start, but also look at right-leaning media as well (you can find versions/evaluations cross the internet.  Here's [Allsides's](https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/media-bias-chart) breakdown.)

I'd also throw in a bit more opinion sites, especially those that tend to update their news more frequently.  Again, both sides so you can get an idea of what each is focusing on.

Not so much daily tracking, but I’ve found the following two Australian resources incredibly helpful.    
In-depth analysis and background on a topic, cutting out all of the ‘crazy’ [no offence intended]  

I found both incredibly valuable, since the Australian public broadcaster has no as and is taxpayer funded:    Means they don’t need hyperbole and aren’t beholden to corporate interests.   
The whole prob of attracting or ticking off advertisers doesn’t arise.   

Both are a lot more down to earth than most free U.S. outlets:   I’ve found YouTube vids to have super-hyperbolic titles ….. and then I wasted like half an hour watching something that was fairly uninformed I’ve and underwhelming. 😢 

Maybe have a look at the two shows below, see if either might be helpful:  

_’Planet America’_

Ask_Politics,top,Why was NYC always heavily democrat?,12,11,1,"The story that Democrats and Republicans ""switched"" positions sometime in the 30s is an oversimplification. Democrats and Republicans were big-tent parties with Progressive and Conservative factions. Republicans, after the Civil War, while taking the ""left"" stance on Reconstruction and Civil Rights,  very quickly became associated with Northern Business interests. Democrats took the mantle of ""populism."" 

The Progressive movement within both the Republican and Democratic parties vied for the vote of the urban working class, while Democrats increasingly embraced the populist concerns of midwestern farmers (along with their white southern base). The Democrats also developed close ties to""white ethnics,"" Jewish, Irish, Italian, and, to a lesser extent, Germans. This coalition,  white ethnics,  some portion of the working class, and anyone annoyed with whoever the Republican president was quickly became a majority in NYC

People also voted for more based on the relationships they had with local politicians and the Tammany Hall Society, which ran NYC politics for about a hundred years from around the 1860s to the 1940s and was close with the Democratic party

Democrats built loyalty through aid and policies like the New Deal, while the city’s liberal, educated vibe keeps it blue. GOP wins (like Giuliani) are rare and usually moderate.

Ask_Politics,top,Why Did the Democrats Unanimously Confirm Marco Rubio?,10,9,1,"On a broader level, confirmation is not meant to be about agreeing with candidates on everything - but about vetting to see if they would be viable, competent, and fit for the job.

(And I say this as a Floridian and a Democrat who finds Rubio to be the most spineless excuse for someone who loves to claim he's on moral high ground) By that measure, Rubio isn't a particularly controversial pick. He's been in the Senate for 14 years, and in the Florida House before that. He's sat as both [Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee and as a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs.](https://www.congress.gov/member/marco-rubio/R000595)

On a political level, you have to choose your battles - while sure maybe it didn't have to be unanimous, politicians need to face the reality of the situation on how many nominations they can realistically fight and how many they can even oppose if they pass. And in this case, Democrats likely feel they need to conserve their political capital to fight what they see as the most egregious nominations of unqualified and/or radical nominations. Rubio is neither of those - again, saying that as someone who really dislikes him (even moreso now seeing what his spinelessness is leading him to advocate for (including on closing refugee admissions - by which his own family arrived to this country - and on the admin's opposition to birthright citizenship - by which he himself is a citizen of the United States since neither of his parents were citizens yet when he was born)",6,2025-02-03 20:31:56,2025-02-08 07:13:42

Some quotes:

**American voters are less ideologically polarized than they think they are, and that misperception is greatest for the most politically engaged people**. 

However, most partisans hold major misbeliefs about the other party’s preferences that lead them to think there is far less shared policy belief. This perception gap is highest among progressive activists, followed closely by extreme conservatives: in other words, the people who are most involved in civic and political life hold the least accurate views of the other side’s beliefs. Figure 1 shows the gap between what groups of Americans think the other side believes and what they self-report believing, as of 2019.

**American politicians are highly ideologically polarized. In other words, they believe in and vote for different sets of policies, with little overlap. This trend has grown in a steady, unpunctuated manner for decades.** 

One reason that the most highly politically engaged Americans may misunderstand the other side is that they correctly estimate the extreme ideological polarization among politicians. 

While at this point, candidates and parties may be responding to polarized primary voters, candidates and parties have been driving the polarization, and not all voters are ideologically polarized. 

The disparity between where leaders are ideologically and where their voters are precludes legislative policy agreement on many issues. Average voters are not able to assert their (often weak) policy preferences because they do not have an effective way to vote out representatives who do not accurately represent their constituents’ views, particularly on the right where party chairs are likely to substitute one extreme candidate for another.

**Even though Americans are not as ideologically polarized as they believe themselves to be, they** ***are*** **emotionally polarized (known as “affective polarization”). In other words, they do not like members of the other party.** 

Americans harbor strong dislike for members of the other party (though they also dislike their own parties, as well). While social media is often blamed for this phenomenon, affective polarization started growing before the internet: its onset more closely correlates with the rise of cable news and radio talk shows.

**Similarly, affective polarization is not causing political violence directly. It is probably contributing to an environment that allows politicians and opinion leaders to increase violence targeted at politicians, election officials, women, and many types of minorities.** 

Affective polarization in the United States has been rising for decades, while political violence only increased sharply in 2016. Affective polarization is also quite symmetrical across parties, while political violence is overwhelmingly from the right. This suggests that emotional feelings of hatred toward members of the other party are not a primary cause of political violence. ",15,2025-01-05 06:03:44,2025-01-05 22:47:14
