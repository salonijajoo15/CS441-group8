PoliticalDiscussion,top,Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell acknowledges that Trump killed the biggest border security bill in decades so he could campaign on the issue instead. What will this mean for the election?,"Link to his words on it:

And here's a link to the bill being killed earlier this year:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-republicans-block-border-security-bill-campaign-border-chaos-rcna153607

McConnell had given the green light for James Lankford, a conservative Republican, to negotiate a comprehensive border security package with Democrats led by Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate border state Senator from Arizona. The final package was agreed to by all parties and signed off on by McConnell as well as Democratic leaders before Trump publicly came out against it and urged his allies in the House and Senate GOP to kill it. The reason, according to widespread reporting including the above, was that he wanted to run his campaign on there being chaos at the border and him being the solution to fix it, and he worried that the proposed bill would resolve the problem and deprive him of something to run on. 

Since then, Trump has made immigration and the idea of a border crises the central point of his campaign. He's gone to every border state to rant about it and lambast Democrats for not fixing it. He's brought it up in every appearance, at every interview, at the presidential debate. He's tied the border to false stories about migrants coming over to eat people's pets. He brings it up at every rally. Yet it was he himself who worked to ensure that it wasn't fixed, and now his own party's Senate leader acknowledges it.

Condemning Trump over it the week before the election, in which millions have already early voted, does not do much.

Cannon and the conservative SCOTUS are the only reason Trump wasn't rotting in a prison cell on November 4th.

PoliticalDiscussion,top,Is the American population beginning to turn on Trump?,"Several prominent Anti-Trump voices have 
recently publicly stated that they think that the nation has hit a turning point because of the recent events in the past week.  

Robert Reich expressed his views in a  substack article entitled ""The Sleeping Giant Is Awakening"" (It won't let me link a sub stack article, you'll have to Google it).  Reich argues that Trump’s blatant authoritarian behavior over the course of a week — suing the New York Times, attacking reporters, cheering censorship, threatening to pull network licenses, and demanding prosecutions of rivals — has finally gone too far for many Americans. The backlash, seen most clearly in the massive Disney boycott and Trump’s falling poll numbers, shows the public is no longer just grumbling but actively resisting. Reich believes this marks the “sleeping giant” of American democracy awakening, as it has in past crises like McCarthyism, civil rights, Vietnam, and Watergate.

Historian Heather Cox Richardson agreed with Reich in her semi-weekly [Politics Chat live stream](https://youtu.be/AQ2ZxeneQrk), citing similar examples while also emphasizing that his poll numbers are trending downward — including approval on his performance with the economy, immigration, among other areas.  She also cites how several notable right-wing figures used their platform to speak out against Trump's infringements on the First Amsnsmen— noting that the struggle is becoming the American people vs. an increasingly authoritarian government, rather than left vs. right.

I was mostly right, but I was shocked by how such a large amount of people could support him even after what he did.

When he incited a mob to attack the capital and stop the counting of the election results, I was convinced that his political career was dead in the water and that people would never consider electing him again.

When he overturned Roe v Wade by appointing far-right extremists to the Supreme Court to give states the right to ban abortion, I was again convinced that he didn't have a chance at being elected again.

When he asked the Georgia Secretary of State to help find him votes, I believed that voters would see him as corrupt and scummy and that they wouldn't think of electing him again.

When he ran on a platform that didn't address the needs of working class at all and instead went on rants about Haitians eating cats and dogs, I thought that he was finally finished and would get trounced in the 2024 election.

I've been proven wrong about the electorate and my faith that people would do the right thing has been shaken. There is a chance that Trump will declare himself King in 2028 and refuse to leave office, knowing that the majority of the population would shrug their shoulders and let him get away with everything just like they have since 2016.

The truth is that it's very difficult to tell how much America is willing to tolerate from its leader, because every time we hit a rock bottom he drags us even further down. America feels adrift without any clear direction, like its lost in the woods. One third of the country is cheering on the wrongdoing, one third is shocked and horrified, and one third is apathetic and tunes it all out. I'm not sure what it would take, if anything, to jolt the apathetic into action and have the majority of the population realize the gravity of the situation.

PoliticalDiscussion,top,President Trump has proposed sending US citizens to El Salvador's notorious maximum security prison. Would the Supreme Court likely allow this?,"In recent months, the Trump administration has begun a controversial deportation policy that involves sending immigrants to El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT). This facility is a maximum-security prison that holds tens of thousands of suspected gang members. 

CECOT has drawn criticism from international human rights organizations. Prisoners are often held without formal charges. They are denied access to legal counsel, and they have almost no contact with the outside world. They are confined in overcrowded cells and movement is heavily restricted.

SCOTUS  has confirmed the only way to punish a president is by impeachment, so as it stands currently Trump can (eith his majority in the House and Senate) ignore any SCOTUS order and not woret about consequences as he is sure that he will not be impeached.  

I truly believe that when POTUS starts to deport US citizens and he is told to stop, our congress will defend him stating thst these are the most violent criminals and they can be sent anywhere to serve their sentences.  When Trump leaves office he will face charges that when they reach SCOTUS  they will shrug and say he should have been impeached.

My reason isn't so wishful.  Judges in American courts are highly protective of their authority.  Snub one of their rulings or act out of order in their presence, and they will predictably get agitated about it.

This is true across the spectrum.  Federal or state/local.  Liberal, conservative, or anywhere in between: Piss off a judge and you're hosed.

I believe that they may start holding these DOJ lawyers in contempt and fining them personally for every day that their orders are defied.  The Supreme Court will back them on this because they also don't like their rulings being disrespected.  What they won't want is another branch of government treating them as if they have no power.

Judges can often be petty and that is usually a bad thing.  This is where it may do some good.

EDIT: A CNN interview posted today.  This retired federal district court judge is commenting about the potential for the district court to find contempt, etc.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQY6VjwGa0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQY6VjwGa0)

EDIT 2:  Abrego's counsel is requesting contempt.  The judge is starting the discovery process. Depositions are anticipated.

I would expect this to not go well for DOJ.  I would expect sanctions and the basis being established for civil trials being filed against the individuals involved.  Pardons won't allow them to avoid civil litigation.

Does anyone care about debt any longer?",1118,1084,34,"Hospitals and medical clinics will close, especially in rural areas… many facilities have anywhere from 20%-80% Medicaid patients. Medical insurance will go up for everyone - ACA recipients, Medicare recipients, and private insurance. Medical costs and prescription costs will go up for everyone - when folks get on the ER only plan it increases costs across the whole system. Considering we fixed absolutely nothing after COVID with hospital staffing, we still have skeleton crews and hospitals wait times are already incredibly high… those wait times will increase. 

In short, a lot of people will die because of this bill. The federal government is the largest insurer in the US, this Congress and Trump just stripped a big chunk of federal negotiating power. It’s going to decimate the medical industry. As many have pointed out, yes, it won’t “take effect” for a couple years, but these will be the results. 

In terms of SNAP, we will see childhood hunger increase again - after decades of work to erase it. Families will go hungry and we don’t have the infrastructure to replace SNAP with private or nonprofit resources. By the way, there’s a stat that for every dollar spent on food assistance, poverty assistance, unemployment, etc we get back on average $7. A 700% ROI into the economy, the GDP, and tax revenue - that’s gone. 

Democrats should run on this and making life affordable again for ALL Americans, nonstop for the foreseeable future until everyone who voted for this bill is out.

Sometimes you wish he wouldn’t “bow down” to the corporate-dem majority in government, but sometimes, like in this situation, he is tethered to reality and is COMPLETELY right. 

A person who wants to protest Harris’s Gaza-Israel policy by either not voting or voting Jill Stein, is in my opinion a person who doesn’t argue in good-faith or just incredibly ignorant and most definitely privileged. 

So I don’t have much faith in Bernie’s very rational arguments here persuading a person like that to change their mind. 

I hope it does change at least a few people’s minds though. It might. 
But my perception is that the people he’s trying to appeal to, are mostly not operating in good-faith and have other motives all together.",801,2024-10-30 04:41:05,2024-10-30 05:27:50,0.6

The people he’s trying to reach usually do not vote in the best of circumstances and in my view many of them are disingenuous and dishonest in the sense that they don’t actually want power, but they instead want to endlessly critique power as backseat drivers essentially. 

Basically the Dems can do no good in their eyes and we’ve seen this in real time with real examples from people in that sphere. 

“We won’t vote for Joe Biden or Donald Trump.” 

*Dems get rid of Biden and put up Harris.

“No no. That won’t do.” 

“We won’t vote for Kamala if she picks Shapiro.”

*Picks Tim Walz

“No no. That won’t do.” 

“We won’t vote for Kamala if she doesn’t call for a ceasefire or embargo.” 

*Calls for both

“No no. That won’t do.” 

Sensing a pattern? They will always move the goalposts. Always. They hide behind statements like “We just want this one, little thing.” But that’s not true. They just want more and more and more and it’s never ever enough. 

That’s why nobody courts them. Harris would literally have better luck peeling off people who have voted Republican their entire life who are disgusted by the Trump rhetoric than they would any of these people because they simply cannot take a win graciously. It’s just constant bitching and moaning about EVERYTHING. ",199,2024-10-30 04:41:05,2024-10-30 06:50:03,0.5

Will this video change any minds among those who view the Biden-Harris administration in too negative a light to vote for Kamala Harris?",1109,1042,67,"I watched the video last night when he posted it, and his arguments boil down to:

* Trump would produce worse outcomes for Palestinians

* There are several other important issues at stake

Which I personally find rational, and compelling arguments, but as I understand are not the arguments that reach the kind of disaffected voters he is trying to reach.

This group of staunch protest voters (who I would contend have a disproportionate presence online) are single issue voters, and are voters who view their vote as something important, representative of their values, and to be earned.

Not trying to straw man, but from what I see online from this kind of voter thinks: 

A) My vote should be earned. If me not voting is going to lose Kamala the election, then as a self-interested politician, she should make concessions to my position to earn my vote.

B) The conflict in Gaza is a genocide, and genocide is a red line that cannot be crossed. Any support for it is morally indefensible. 

The argument Donald Trump is worse conflicts with A, and the argument that they should compromise conflicts with B. Both seem to be received poorly by this group of voters.

How to better reach them? I can't say for sure, but I think the focus needs to be on existing pro-Gaza policy & statements & on a vote for Harris as vote for the entire Democratic Coalition, which includes the Democrats currently advocating for Palestinians. Emphasize the ceasefire efforts, Biden threatening an Arms Embargo, Kamala 'boycotting' Netanyahu's speech to congress several months ago. And emphasize that Kamala being in the White House empowers the Pro-Palestinian politicians in the Democratic Party. AOC made this point really well in one or two of her recent livestreams, that having a president from the Democratic Coalition puts politicians like her, Rashida Tlaib, and Bernie Sanders in positions of power to negotiate and influence policy. I think Bernie could have alluded to the fact that he currently is championing Arms Embargo legislation in the Senate, and the fact that as a Senator in a closely split Senate, he is a key vote and could use that position to further this kind of policy goal. 

That said, I think probably the majority of voters for whom Gaza is an important issue are not this disaffected protest voter block, and I think that a significant portion of the disaffected protest voter block is not interested in being reached. Anecdotally, the people I know in real life view Biden/Harris very negatively on the Gaza issue and are still planning on voting for her, having already come to the conclusions Sanders presents on their own. 

But you never know for sure! Take my word with a grain of salt, all my intuition on public perception of this issue comes from my anecdotal experiences, and reading far too many arguments on twitter.",28,2024-10-30 04:41:05,2024-10-30 07:31:24,0.7

The much more youthful, experienced woman was rejected. What does America actually want?",1079,1014,65,"I think that Biden and Trump, from an age perspective, are outliers due to a specific set of circumstances that ultimately had nothing to do with age.

For example, Trump was a dark horse candidate that (initially) nobody expected to win. Ted Cruz was the expected favorite, followed by Marco Rubio and John Kasich. Cruz is 54 (right now); while I wouldn't call that young, he's still a lot younger than Biden or Trump. He's even younger than Harris by a few years. Cruz and Rubio are very close to the same age, while Kasich is closer to Trump's. My point is that if Trump didn't show up as a surprise favorite in the primaries, the Republican candidate for President would have been (at the time) 46 years old, which is not even close to an unreasonable age. That's actually exactly as old as Bill Clinton was when he became President.

As for the blue side - Clinton and Biden are roughly around the same age as Trump, but their presence in the political landscape was likely due to their association with past popular Democrat presidents. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama both had solid job approval ratings. Post-Reagan, Bill was #1 and Barack was #2. So it kind of makes sense that the Dems would tap these two for the job. Or in other words, I don't think they *couldn't* find a younger candidate. Just that there were reasons to go with these two. (Not that I think it was an amazing reason. Just that it's somewhat disconnected from the issue of age alone.)

The tl;dr version - very specific circumstances led us to the candidates we had in the 2024 election and it's not necessarily indicative of a desire to make sure we have 70+ year old people as President.

I also don't think that it was Biden's age, all by itself, that was the issue. Every public speaker makes gaffes or gets tongue-tied from time to time. If you had to talk all day, you'd do it too - it's normal. The issue is that Biden very obviously had problems that went beyond just ordinary flubs. It wasn't just Fox News saying that, either. Major Democratic Party members and big-time donors pushed for it, and even the New Yorker (notable left-wing publication) wrote a scathing article about this. There wouldn't have been a push for Biden to step down if this wasn't a factor.",55,2024-12-30 01:09:23,2024-12-30 01:44:36,0

That is what a democracy does in the face of violence. It waits for facts, it honours the dead, and it upholds justice without weaponising grief. But that’s not what happened in the United States. Elon Musk jumped online and branded the left “the party of murderers” before anyone knew the shooter’s motive. That isn’t just reckless. It is a deliberate act of incitement. He knows his words will be repeated, amplified, and believed. He knows he can smear millions as killers with a single post. And he knows it drags America closer to civil conflict.

Donald Trump followed with the same poison. He blamed the “radical left” without a shred of evidence. It wasn’t a mistake. It was the script. Accuse first. Invent facts later. Repeat until truth is unrecognisable. That is not democracy. That is authoritarianism. It is the same tactic Putin uses to justify war. The same tactic Xi uses to crush dissent. And now it is the tactic of Trump and Musk. Not to strengthen America, but to dismantle it from within.

The hypocrisy is not subtle. Two months ago, a MAGA extremist murdered a Democratic state legislator, her husband, and their dog. Another state senator and his wife were shot and barely survived. The attacker carried a kill list of dozens more Democrats. And what was the Republican response? Silence. No outrage. No demands for action. No mourning of public servants executed for their party affiliation. Nothing.

This silence is not new. It is part of the record. A Trump supporter mailed live pipe bombs to Democrats and journalists. Armed extremists plotted to kidnap and execute the governor of Michigan. On 6 January, Trump told his followers to “fight like hell.” They stormed the Capitol. They hunted lawmakers through the halls of Congress. They beat police officers bloody. They carried Confederate flags through a building that symbolises the Republic itself. And Trump sat back and called them “patriots.” He promised them pardons.

In 2025, he delivered. Nearly 1,600 rioters had their sentences wiped clean. Leaders of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers convicted of sedition walked free. Men with long records of violence, abuse, child exploitation, sexual crimes, absolved. These were not patriots. They were criminals. And instead of punishment they got protection. Some now have the audacity to sue the government, demanding millions from the very democracy they tried to burn down.

This is not random hypocrisy. This is sabotage. It is a conscious project to hollow out democracy and replace it with chaos. Musk and Trump feed the machine with lies. They turn tragedy into propaganda. They excuse extremists when they wear the right hat, and they smear opponents as murderers when they don’t. They are not stumbling into danger. They are building it.

And here is the clearest proof: compare America to other democracies. Brazil faced the same challenge. Jair Bolsonaro tried to cling to power after losing in 2022. He plotted a coup. He incited riots. He fed the same lies of a “stolen election.” And what happened? Brazil’s institutions held. Bolsonaro was tried, convicted, and sentenced to 27 years in prison for plotting insurrection, leading a criminal group, and undermining democracy. Twenty-seven years. That is what accountability looks like. That is how a democracy survives.

Now look at the United Kingdom. Only yesterday the UK government fired its ambassador to the United States for ties to Jeffrey Epstein. Peter Mandelson had emails defending Epstein, calling him “best pal,” coaching him to fight his conviction. The moment this became undeniable, he was sacked. No excuses. No protecting a powerful man because of his connections. No pretending it didn’t matter. Action was taken immediately. That is how democracies defend their legitimacy.

And now look back at America. Donald Trump, a man with his own ties to Epstein, a man who incited an insurrection, a man who promised and delivered pardons to seditionists, sits as President again. Not in exile, not in prison, not disgraced. Elected. Empowered. Protected. That is not democracy. That is rot. It is a global embarrassment.

If I wanted to design a machine to collapse America from within, I wouldn’t need to invent one. I would hand the microphone to Elon Musk and the stage to Donald Trump. Between them, they already serve as that machine. They spread lies. They legitimise violence. They shield extremists. They corrode institutions. They have written the script for America’s slow self-destruction. And the country, eyes wide open, follows them step by step toward collapse.

Democracy has rules. Evidence comes before accusation. Violence is punished, not excused. Power is checked, not worshipped. Corruption is exposed, not ignored. That is how Brazil defended itself. That is how the UK defended itself. That is how functioning democracies survive. The United States has abandoned these principles. It protects the guilty and persecutes the innocent. It weaponises tragedy. It pardons traitors.

This is not leadership. This is treason by another name. It corrodes democracy, destabilises society, and hands victory to America’s enemies abroad. Unless it is confronted, unless it is called out for what it truly is, an organised campaign to normalise violence, excuse extremists, and destroy trust, the collapse will not be an accident. It will be a choice. And it will be the end of the American Republic.",100,2025-09-12 03:20:17,2025-09-12 04:22:22,0.95

Asked about Mr. Bolsonaro’s conviction, Mr. Trump told reporters in Washington on Thursday that he was “very unhappy about it. I know President Bolsonaro” and like him, he said. “I think it’s a terrible thing, very terrible. I actually think it’s very bad for Brazil.”

He has to cut something. But nothing is big enough. Most of the federal government expenses are Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the military and interest on the national debt.Everything else put together, foreign aid, NASA, the Justice Department, National Parks, the CDC, border patrol, etc… doesn’t come close to those big items. They could get rid of literally the entire US government, besides those five things, and still not be able to balance the budget, let alone cut taxes more.

What Trump wants to do is impossible, what DOGE says they are going to do (2 trillion in cuts) is impossible. All they are doing is making a lot of noise firing all those federal workers. It won’t have much of an effect on the deficit and certainly not pay for Trump tax cuts. So they have to attack something big like Social Security.  But people like Social Security so they need a reason to cut it that people will accept. Finding waste, fraud and abuse (I’m so sick of hearing those terms) is a handy cliche and is good political theater they can use to justify doing something everybody is going hate. It also justifies the existence of DOGE, something else a lot of people are hating on, if they are out there fighting the boogie man. That fact that the boogie man is made up matters not even a little bit. As long as they can convince enough people that the boogie man is real and is a threat it lets them do whatever they want.

",1024,993,31,"When the administration first blundered the Epstein tape two weeks ago with the missing minute(s), I theorized the 'Epstein didn't kill himself' meme was bigger than the right wing spin machine was able to overcome, and I stand by that theory. Trump gleefully embraced the Epstein meme, as pedophilia is salacious and engaging for his bloodthirsty base - and American society in general - but it appears this was another example of Trump's projection.

I think Trump is panicking because he's in deeper than most of Epstein's other clients. Virginia Giuffre was recruited from Mar-a-Lago by Ghislane Maxwell. Trump owned Miss Teen USA starting in 1996, and Trump Model Management in 1999. Was Giuffre really the only woman trafficked through Trump's numerous businesses centered around young women? Once you take even more than a cursory look at their relationship it stinks.

The media slow walking this is icing on the cake. The Washington Post has played the administration again and again, with Trump's team sleepwalking into unforced error after error. I'm curious if the Thiel arm of the conservative movement has decided Trump has outlived his usefulness, and they're ready to burn him (and a likely Mossad honeypot) to get their puppet in office, and have coordinated with Musk to pop the media bubble for the more conspiracy minded conservatives.",302,2025-07-23 21:57:46,2025-07-24 00:01:29,0.9

",1024,993,31,"The Republicans have protected Epstein since at least 2005.  

2005 - March 2005: Police in Palm Beach, Florida, begin investigating Epstein after the family of a 14-year-old girl reported she was molested at his mansion. Multiple underage girls, many of them high school students, would later tell police Epstein hired them to give sexual massages.

May 2006: Palm Beach police charge Epstein with multiple counts of unlawful sex with a minor. The county’s top prosecutor, State Attorney Barry Krischer, takes the unusual step of sending the case to a grand jury.

June 2006: The grand jury hears from only ONE accuser and indicts Epstein with one count of solicitation of prostitution. Accusations from other victims, many of whom were minors, are NOT EVEN INCLUDED in the indictment.

July 2006: The relatively minor charge draws attention, including from Palm Beach Police leaders, who slam Krischer for giving Epstein special treatment. The FBI opens a federal investigation that involves multiple accusers in Florida, New York and elsewhere in the U.S.

2007: Federal prosecutors prepare an indictment against Epstein. But for a year, the financier’s lawyers engaged in talks with the U.S. attorney in Miami, ALEXANDER ACOSTA, about a plea bargain that would allow Epstein to avoid federal prosecution. Epstein’s lawyers argued that his accusers are unreliable witnesses.

June 2008: Epstein pleaded guilty to one count of soliciting prostitution and one count of soliciting prostitution from a minor. He was sentenced to 18 months in jail, a year of community service and is registered as a sex offender.
Under a secret arrangement, the U.S. attorney’s office agreed not to prosecute Epstein for federal crimes. Epstein served most of his sentence in a work-release program that allowed him to leave the jail during the day to go to his office and return to his cell at night. Amazing - Acosta crafted a secret deal for a pedophile!!!

July 2009: Epstein is released from jail. For the next decade, multiple women who say they are Epstein’s victims wage a legal fight to get his federal non-prosecution agreement voided, and hold him and others liable for the abuse.

November 2018: The Miami Herald revisited the handling of Epstein’s case in a series of stories focusing partly on the role of Acosta — who by this point is President Donald Trump’s labor secretary — in arranging his unusual plea deal. The coverage renews public interest in the case.

July 2019: Epstein is arrested on federal sex trafficking charges after federal prosecutors in New York concluded they weren’t bound by the earlier plea deal. Days after the arrest, Acosta resigned as labor secretary amid public outrage over his role in the initial investigation.

August 10, 2019: Guards find Epstein dead in his cell at a federal jail in New York City. Investigators concluded he died by suicide.

So from 2005 sexual abuse of a 14-year old to 2019, Republicans lied and protected Epstein, his associates and his wealthy, powerful pedophile clients, in fact he continued to traffick teenagers from his release in 2009 to his arrest in 2019, he had 10 years to freely abuse and rape kids and no one did anything to stop him.

Acosta is

They have been told for almost a decade that once the good guys take office, they can finally expose the cabal and impose justice. The agreement was that in order to bust the Liberal Elites, they will need Agent Orange in the White House to break through the expansive government coverup. Now they are faced head on with two distinct and mutually exclusive options:

**They’ve been tricked into electing someone based on lies they’ve been told, playing them for fools**

OR

**They’re currently being lied to and this administration is part of the deep state coverup, playing them for fools.**",437,2025-07-13 12:57:55,2025-07-13 23:46:25,0.6
PoliticalDiscussion,top,Donald Trump's MAGA seems to be splitting on the Epstein files more than on any previous controversy that he was involved in. Why is this the trigger? What is it about the list that is causing them to finally break from supporting him?,"In recent days some of MAGA's more outspoken influencers are rushing to call out the Trump administration's failure to release the unredacted ""Epstein files"", a set of documents that detailed events organized by convicted predator Michael Epstein that, according to his criminal case, included sexual exploitation with numerous underage girls. 

Other influencers and appointees are defending the Trump administration, causing what appears to be a schism in the ""MAGAsphere"". Donald Trump has posted several tweets and made comments in other venues that indicate he wishes this to go entirely away, but instead, the story seems to be gaining traction.

**Why?** What about THIS EVENT seems to be blowing up MAGA more than others? Are numerous media reports on the fraction exaggerated? Why did this trigger a schism when so many of Trump's previous questionable actions have not? Will this go away, or will it continue to build into a full split in the loose ""MAGAsphere""?

They think that Epstein was involved with child sex trafficking for those people in the “deep state” and Trump has spent years fanning the flames of this conspiracy, along with other conspiracies that are part of Q. They also believe that Hitler was not a bad guy because he was just trying to eliminate the blood drinking, child molesting Jewish cabal. So basically, the people who are the foundation of the MAGA movement, being QAnon believers, voted for Trump with the expectation that he would blow the lid off allllll kinds of conspiracies and thus confirm that they, the QAnon believers, really are smarter than everyone else because they caught on and others didn’t — to be clear, it’s never been about protecting children; it’s about stroking their own egos. Understand that a lot of QAnon believers have their entire personalities tied into the conspiracy. Being told now that evidence doesn’t exist to support their conspiracy, and nothing will even be released for them to see for themselves, makes Trump a part of the cover up conspiracy himself.

There is a huge demographic shift happening and in the works. Cuomo was a bad candidate, but in practicality he was leading every poll in a commanding lead before this young guy with the right energy showed up and went from what, dead last to \*crushing\* a victory in record time. He got people to knock on 1.5 million fucking doors -- all with no money, and only a bit of charisma and giving voice to values that people care about.

To me, the significance is not about how it shakes the Democrats (though that is certainly a consideration), the important thing here is to note the demographic shift. Young people are coming out. Things like this are going to show them that money does not win elections -- it's hitting on the topics that people care about and giving them a voice, that \*does\*.

Healthcare, Childcare, Work/Life balance, pay equity, equitable taxation, etc are things that not Zohran was elected for -- it was what TRUMP was elected for. There's a groundswell of people that viciously are voting for the things that they find important, and the ""hey I'll give you a $200 tax cut"" approach of the people in the past simply does not work any more. You have to speak to the things that people care about, and it is addressing the wealth gaps, the lack of healthcare, and the inability to buy a home and start a family.

Zohran won because he voiced those things and gave value to them, so the younger voters felt some energy and came out to vote for what values he was espousing. They delivered him the victory. And this point can be replicated over and over, in almost any area with the right charismatic candidate, and win elections. And Democrats need to come to terms with that and start running candidates that espouse those values, rather than the corporate Democrats of the past.",7,2025-06-25 09:55:42,2025-06-25 13:47:04,0.9

Yes. This is a classic inflationary policy. Other inflationary policies include tariffs, deporting immigrants and pressuring the fed to keep interest rates low. In response to greater geopolitical instability caused by increased isolationism we may also see more countries opt for onshoring which will further drive up costs. If Trump really does go through with most of his policies there will be inflation.

Given that Trump's tarrifs will be applied to all countries, I imagine similar block responses will occur, especially with countries already belonging to economic or political groups such as the African Union. So right away, bilateral deals are out the window. I don't think Trump really has the political cover to outlast any of these blocks, even if they are harmed more by the tarrifs and reciprocal tarrifs in the shortrun.

In reality, I think that what will end up happening is that all of this is going to benefit China. It will force the EU to militarize and thus increase their industrial capacities. It increase the importance of the African Union and their member nations, perhaps being taken with more urgency for relations with the EU. And it will make it so that nations will look to replace American dependencies overtime, which will make Trump's hand weaker over time, especially when Trump is facing a harsh recession entirely of his own doing.

Regardless of party lines, does the President have the authority to alter or demolish part of the White House without statutory review? And if not, has the required process been followed?

Here are the laws that seem to apply:

1. National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA), 16 U.S.C. § 470 et seq. – Requires consultation with the *Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP)* before altering or demolishing any federally protected structure.
2. Section 106 of the NHPA – Mandates a *public review and interagency consultation* before construction begins.
3. Executive Order 11593 (1971) – Directs the President and all federal agencies to *“provide leadership in preserving the historic and cultural environment of the Nation.”*
4. The Antiquities Act of 1906, 16 U.S.C. § 431–433 – Prohibits unauthorized destruction or alteration of historically significant federal sites.
5. National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) – Requires environmental and historical impact reviews for major federal projects.
6. Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. § 541 et seq. – Governs management of federal property and requires compliance with law and oversight.
7. Appropriations Clause, U.S. Constitution (Art. I, § 9, cl. 7) – *“No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law.”*

If federal funds are being used without authorization, that could raise constitutional issues.

Here's the thing, they are primarily a product of the propaganda they consume. Most of them rarely see any news outside of Fox News. They're immersed in it, and it shapes their opinion.

If you want to really respond, the first response needs to be directed not a Trump, but at the right wing media. You've got to try and change the information diet the MAGA folks are on. Only then will it be possible to shift the political landscape.

There are two angles to approach the problem from. The first is money - make it a business liability to support Fox News. Boycott advertisers. Protest them. Picket their main office. Make them want to pull their ads.

The second is to provide an alternate flood of information. This does not mean arguing with them or calling them names. This means providing the same appeal that their existing information provides - play to their outrage, tell them they're smart. But let the payoff reveal facts. Kind of an ""IQ Anon"" to feed their addiction.  
  
Or just use your info stream to turn them against the backseat enablers of the right wing media.

PoliticalDiscussion,top,Who is benefiting from these tariffs?,"From my basic understanding of what is happening here, the intention of tariffs is that companies will move to manufacturing items here in the US rather than buy overseas.

Even worse, it's almost guaranteed that other countries will retaliate, which means American exporters will also suffer.  So people are going to be losing jobs as well as suffering higher prices.  


But it's worth it, to bring back American manufacturing, right?  But it's not going to do that either.  Factories take many years to build.  Longer than an election cycle.  Raising taxes and a recession are a death sentence  for the Republican party.  If I'm a manufacturing company, I'm not going to build any new factories, I'm going to ride this out and wait for Democrats to remove these tariffs.  So manufacturing doesn't win either.


No one wins here.  It's such a monumentally stupid thing to do.  ",1680,2025-04-02 21:48:50,2025-04-03 00:23:47,0.5

I know people often like to say that the economic elite want the economy to crash because then they can buy things for cheap, but that's honestly just goofy conspiracy-mongering.

Business owners want a good economy because then they have more money and then they have more stuff.  The 2008 Great Recession was not good for anyone.  No one wanted that to happen.

The most dangerous thing about Trump's presidency isn't that it's populated by people who are cynically just trying to get rich.

PoliticalDiscussion,top,Why isn't Congress acting to preserve its power?,"My understanding of our federal government's structure is that the Founders wanted to channel self-interest into preventing the centralization of power: create separate branches, give them the ability to knock the others down a peg, and any time a branch feels like their own power is faltering or being threatened, they can kick those checks and balances into gear and level the playing field. This separation of powers was also formulated across extremely fundamental lines: those who make the laws, those who interpret the laws, and those who execute the laws.

>Mr. Trump had gotten word that Senator Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, planned to oppose Pete Hegseth, the former “Fox & Friends” weekend host who was his choice for Pentagon chief, and who faced accusations of excessive drinking and abusing women. If Mr. Tillis could not be brought to heel by that night, there would be enough Republican “no” votes to sink Mr. Hegseth’s confirmation, a humiliating defeat at the dawn of Mr. Trump’s second term.

>Turning to a group of North Carolina lawmakers who were flying with him to survey storm damage in their state, Mr. Trump noted Mr. Tillis’s impending defection and posed a question: Which of them wanted his endorsement for a primary challenge to the senator next year?

>The implication was clear: Mr. Tillis’s refusal to back Mr. Hegseth could cost him his seat. By that night, Mr. Tillis, who had been toiling behind the scenes for days to kill Mr. Hegseth’s nomination so he could avoid having to publicly cross Mr. Trump, would vote to confirm Mr. Hegseth to control the most powerful military force in the world.

>The story of Mr. Tillis’s secret effort to persuade fellow Republicans to join him in opposing Mr. Hegseth — and his sudden turnabout when it became clear he would be the deciding vote to defeat the nominee — is a tale of political calculation and capitulation by a single G.O.P. senator.

>But it also helps explain a broader dynamic at play with Mr. Trump back in the White House, as Republicans in Congress, fearful of reprisal by the president and his supporters, have put aside grave reservations and surrendered to his demands.

You can read about it [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/us/politics/hegseth-trump-tillis-senate.html).

The tl;dr is that, currently, Republicans in Congress feel that ~~defined~~ defying Trump puts them at greater risk of losing re-election than standing up for their constituents. This may change in time, but so early in his honeymoon period, it simply leaves them too vulnerable. 

The article offers another example, Joni Ernst: 

>Senator Joni Ernst, the Iowa Republican and former combat veteran and sexual assault survivor, had been a cautionary tale. After she publicly raised concerns about Mr. Hegseth, Mr. Trump’s hard-line supporters applied unrelenting pressure on Ms. Ernst, including threatening a primary challenge to her re-election bid next year. She retreated, saying she would not try to stand in the way of Mr. Hegseth’s confirmation.

As long as Trump has a death-like grip on Republican primary voters, he has a death-like grip on their elected representatives.

PoliticalDiscussion,top,Why isn't Congress acting to preserve its power?,"My understanding of our federal government's structure is that the Founders wanted to channel self-interest into preventing the centralization of power: create separate branches, give them the ability to knock the others down a peg, and any time a branch feels like their own power is faltering or being threatened, they can kick those checks and balances into gear and level the playing field. This separation of powers was also formulated across extremely fundamental lines: those who make the laws, those who interpret the laws, and those who execute the laws. It would be quite autocratic if any of these mixed, so they are by design separate. Such a fundamental separation also makes each branch very powerful in its own right and outlines very clearly the powers that they have. Barring momentary lapses, it seems like this experimental government has indeed succeeded in avoiding autocracy and oligarchy for some 250 years.


With this framework in mind, you'd think that Congress, even its Republicans, would be fast-acting in impeaching and removing a President who is attempting to assume huge and unprecedented levels of legislative/regulatory authority, and who obviously wants to be the sole authority on legislation. By not acting, they are acknowledging and *allowing* the loss of a great deal of their own power. Why? Were the Founders wrong? Can allegiance outweigh self-interest? Or maybe this is an extension of self-interest; Republicans think that by attaching themselves to a king or MAGA clout, they'll gain the favor thereof. So that would be self-interest that *serves* the creation of autocracy, rather than counteracts. 


I guess the simpler explanation is that impeaching Trump would be politically unpopular among the Republican base, and they fear they might lose congressional elections, but what is even the value in being elected to a branch with its power stolen by the Executive?

They only care that Trump gave them power, power to make more money via taxcuts and deregulation, they don’t care about anything else. A Congressional salary is $174K per year (except for like House Speaker), but after Citizens United, lobbyists and SuperPACS can give politicians unlimited money, anonymously. Elon Musk spent $290M to elect Trump, then saw his wealth increase by $200B due to stock market speculators. John Kenneth Galbraith said “The modern conservative is engaged in one of man's oldest exercises in moral philosophy; that is, the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness.”

Whereas George Washington warned about political parties in his farewell address for that very reason.

Republicans who control Congress are all still scared to death of the dumb Trump mob who attacked Congress & wanted to hang conservative Christian Republican Vice President Mike Pence (who dared to uphold his oath to the Constitution & stand up to Trump). Any Republican who criticizes Trump is labeled a heretic, a “RINO” (even lifelong Republicans, even though Trump was a Democrat until 2009), and banished from the party for “wrongthink.” Only Republicans who have left office, or who are about to leave office, seem to find the courage to criticize Trump. Criticizing Trump has proven to be a political death sentence for several Republicans (unless they later get in line, like Secretary of State Marco Rubio).

[Rightwing authoritarians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_authoritarian_personality) believe we need a mighty leader who will do whatever it takes to defeat the evil creeping into society. About [25%](https://www.businessinsider.com/26-percent-of-americans-are-right-wing-authoritarian-new-poll-2021-6) of Americans are authoritarians. And people who grew up with [authoritarian parents](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/the-legacy-distorted-love/201912/authoritarian-parenting-and-polarization-in-politics) tend to vote for authoritarian politicians. This explains all the weird Republicans calling Trump “daddy” or saying “daddy’s home.”

David Frum wrote “If conservatives become convinced that they can not win democratically, they will not abandon conservatism. They will reject democracy.” Which the Republican Party did in 2020 (and which the Supreme Court arguably did in 2000).

On January 6, 2021, the head of the US Executive Branch, Donald Trump, incited an assault on the entire Legislative Branch, hoping to remain in power, which are the actions of a tyrant or despot, a traitor to our constitutional, representative democracy, presidential republic. But the US court system is so slow (and Trump’s lawyers successfully delayed for so long), that Trump just had to wait 4 years to run & win again.

Republicans in Congress are blindly following the lawless convicted felon they nominated 3x in a row, because Trump was so popular with the poors that the GOP decided idiot Trump was “too big to fail.” The greatest trick the Republican Party ever pulled was getting the poors to vote for billionaires, especially foreign billionaires like Musk & Murdoch. The poors who voted Trump think it’s more likely they’ll become a billionaire, when in reality they’re more likely to become homeless.

Donald Trump is like heroin to white trash in America (and VP Vance said as much, before he also got in line), but the only jobs that Trump seems to be creating for rural communities are Trump Stores where people sell Trump merchandise to other Trumpfans.",10,2025-02-19 19:14:33,2025-02-20 11:39:16,0.95

The first, that there is internal friction and disagreement between these appointees, and Musk. That seems to be the prevailing consensus, but I’m not sure it’s a certainty. 

The second, and the one I worry about, is that some agencies have been excepted from it knowingly by Trump/Musk/other senior decision makers. Essentially, that the agency leadership that has told employees not to respond, are the agencies that have been given permission to do so. 

I’m leaning towards the latter, and that DOGE-occupied OPM just takes a wrecking ball approach to what it does, with little actual coordination on the execution.

There is no cohesive strategy other than doing what the big cheese wants, the only way to know that is to be close to him.  Those who believe they are closest to him will try to carry out his whims but they are also vying for power and influence internally.

Trump loves this as it means everyone has to come running to him or risk looking stupid when a truth social post comes out saying the opposite.

Then he'll cut the winner down later to keep them down and round and round the ouroborus goes.

There are a few people in the Trump administration that wish it did work that way.

",619,563,56,"Unpopular opinion...

I always thought that committee chair positions, especially high profile committees, were long term rewards - people moving from the back bench forward over time rather than leapfrogging longer serving members. some of it is going to come down to established relationships with other committee members / ability to reach across the aisle.

There's also some amount of setup for people in riskier districts - ""look... This person is chair of the powerful committee and can get things done for the district, if you vote for the opponent, they'll be a back bencher on a lower tier committee at best!""

The nationalization of local races is fairly new. It used to be that people barely knew who their own rep was - maybe knew the names of people who lead some major legislation. (Ex: ""sarbanes oxley"" or similar), but probably didn't know the name of someone from 3 states away.

I'm consistently impressed with AOC, I've never heard of the other guy. I do think there are reasons other than personality/social media/etc that may make him the ""better"" choice, at least under the old rules.

Even in general - Republicans have constantly attacked AOC since she got into the office. This makes it hard for her to lead a committee as the minority chair - maybe the majority. The other side won't negotiate in good faith with her as the face - it blows up their standing if they'd ever let her come out and announce a win.

It's possible that the game has changed and that the old guard is playing by the old rules, or maybe the old rules are better somehow, or maybe we're long past time for a changing of the guard but it won't happen until the majority of Congress has turned over. One big challenge there is that the older people vote and the younger people stay home on election day.",90,2024-12-19 01:46:53,2024-12-19 03:04:38,0.5

",619,563,56,"Connolly is not my congressman, but he is for the neighboring district. And you know what? He's a great congressman. He's one of the most progressive in the House. It's been a shame to see so many people excoriate just because he's not AOC, just because he's not someone they've heard of. If we were talking Bernie here, no one would be complaining. But unfortunately, the only politicians anyone seems to care about are the ones to get the most media attraction. So they slap a number on Connolly's forehead, they hear the name Pelosi, and they call it a day. 

Everyone's thinking in very superficial terms, but the fact of the matter is, Pelosi is the best whip of our generation, and she was able to get the votes. If AOC can't get the votes, if she hasn't built the relationships yet, then she's not yet at the level where she would be an effective leader. You don't get there by asking older people to concede. You get there because you convinced enough people that you deserve to be there. That's what makes a leader. People can hate on Pelosi all they want, but she's a damn leader, she's the Democrat's Mitch McConnell, and she's gotten more done in the last 20 years than any other Democratic politician of the last 50 years.

That all said, I do think there is a case for why AOC should be the ranking member on the committee -- we really need to start training the next generation of leadership -- but Connolly is an absolutely fantastic ranking member to have, if it can't be AOC. 

To everyone who's outraged: you're going to forget about this in a week, cause it doesn't actually matter that much to you, it doesn't impact your life, and it doesn't impact the course of politics as it is currently set. AOC probably learned a few lessons this week, and she'll be better prepared in the next session. She's still climbing the ladder, she's still learning the ropes, and I believe she's going to get there in time. But the rest of you just want something to be angry at, because nothing's going our way right now. The only advice I have for you: get the fuck over it. Pelosi wins because she does not give a shit. When she was Speaker, and members of her caucus came up to her, and said that voters in her district don't like her, she says to them ""do what you have to do to win."" She doesn't care if she gets dragged through the mud, all that matters to her is doing the damn job. Once progressives have that mindset, once they stop posturing, stop these ridiculous and unnecessary fights for symbolic purposes, they'll start fucking winning. Until then, they'll just be whiners on the internet, blaming everyone else for the disappointment they bring upon themselves.

What is Elon Musk’s end goal here?  ",610,567,43,"Many are brining up Curtis Yarvin and Techno Fascism and I think that's more of what JD Vance's angle would be given that JD Vance is directly in his position (and his prior senate position) because of Peter Thiel who has directly dabbled with those ideas.

Musk is far simplier to explain. Prior to the election, Musk publicly said (i believe it was on Tucker Carlson) that if Donald Trump didn't win the election, he would be going to prison. And some may have thought he was saying that tongue in cheek but the first things that occurred were inspector generals were fired and then DOGE went after 11 agencies that had 32 pending investigations, pending complaints, or enforcement actions against Musk or one his six companies. 

What's really revealing about all of this is just how little the public understands about government and what is available publicly. There is already an audit of the Federal government by the Office of Management and Budget and the Federal Reserve (despite not being a federal entity) by the US Government Accountability Office (GAO). One done by people who actually understand what they’re looking at. It’s so weird how everyone makes this assumption that nothing in the government gets audited. Most of it does and is publicly available. Anyone who was remotely interested in the idea before could have searched for such things. One part where the federal government has never passed an audit (and the part of the government that pays all of Musk's businesses) is the Department of Defense. If DOGE was interested in finding wasteful spending, they should be looking there and in privatization - not in the civil government that is just carrying out what what Congress is appropriating.

Musk also has no experience doing an audit - which is why this whole thing reeks of corruption and a grift. Let alone that the ""evidence"" they've found shows the level of incompetence and lack of understanding of federal grants and contracts. For those who think Musk could still do an audit effectively despite his lack of expertise, it’s pretty much impossible for someone with his conflicts of interest to do an audit credibly. One of the most important things about an audit is that they are independent auditors without a financial interest in the outcome of the audit. Musk has conflicts of interest all over the place and has already proven that he lets them direct his ‘audit’ (such as shutting down USAID’s investigation of SpaceX).",482,2025-02-26 01:42:32,2025-02-26 03:52:42,0.6

If a sufficient number of members of Congress (50%+1 of the House) want to impeach the President for wearing an ugly tie, they have every authority to do so.

That said, the Trump Presidency has proven that impeachment is an utterly toothless measure. Impeaching someone does absolutely nothing. To remove, you need to convict for impeachment, which requires 2/3 of the Senate to vote to convict. No party is ever going to convict a President of their own party, so you'd need the opposition to have 2/3 of the Senate. Neither party has had 2/3 of the Senate since the 1960s.

For the foreseeable future, until either polarization drops dramatically or one party is able to dominate Congress while the other party holds the White House (both scenarios feel incredibly difficult to imagine right now), no president can be removed from office by impeachment. 

We should really stop thinking about impeachment as a check on the power of the Presidency because, for all intents and purposes, impeachment does not exist.",452,2025-01-29 16:00:25,2025-01-29 19:21:18,0

I’m a never Trump Republican since April 2016 when I attended one of this man’s rallies. I have no idea how so many tens of millions of my fellow countrymen fail to see the hatred, anger, insecurity, narcissism and incompetence that define his character.

His one great talent is turning people against one another. He uses this skill relentlessly, identifying enemies to blame for every grievance, even those which are imagined fantasies.

Biden did a fine job as President. I’m not racing to put him on Mt Rushmore or anything, but he was downright decent. He ran a tight ship, he hired competent staff, he behaved as a President should. But he was a horrible messenger, and his decision to run for re-election was misguided. Democrats needed an open primary so that everybody’s voice could be heard and their issues could be addressed before unifying behind whatever flawed, imperfect person the Democrats nominated to lead the anti-Trump coalition.

That, combined with the absolute failure to prosecute those truly responsible for January 6th were his great mistakes.

In my opinion, when Biden took office, Trump was a defeated blip on the radar of US history. We were very strong, and his leadership made us stronger.

Did Biden provide a realistic assessment of his accomplishment?",612,563,49,"I probably depends on how you define “stronger” and strongly on your political views.  But let’s see:   

Abroad:  
Objectively Russia is much weaker (though not as weak as we’d like) and has lost thousands of troops and hundreds of pieces of equipment including tanks, artillery, planes etc…. There’s an argument that if Russia takes Ukraine it will have been for nothing but that hasn’t happened yet.  

China is in a good place militarily but not economically. They have some financial problems domestically that is hurting their economy, but really nothing we’ve done has meaningfully changed China’s position in the last 4 years.   

North Korea: who knows, they’re probably the same…or maybe better since Russia is giving them stuff now.  

Iran: they’re way worse off. They lost their handle on Syria, Palestine, and their proxies in Yemen are getting wrecked. They’ve had political instability internally and have lost some key leaders.

At home:  

Objectively January of 2021 was not good. We were still in the depths of the Covid economic fallout and facing an ongoing pandemic that hadn’t quite subsided. Our economy by all measures is doing better than any other developed economy and despite inflation, has fared better than most other countries and appears to be nearly resolved. 

Other metrics: crime is down, employment is up.

Certainly there’s plenty of criticisms of Biden: he hasn’t done enough to support Ukraine, the Afghanistan withdrawal was a disaster, the Israel situation is a cluster, inflation remains a problem for most Americans and access to housing is a real problem.

Did Biden provide a realistic assessment of his accomplishment?",612,563,49,"Hard to argue with a lot of that. Biden's legacy will be a hard one to pin down. Few Presidents have such an extreme mix of impressive highs and brutal lows.

Easily one of the most accomplished Presidents of the last fifty years. His team made legislative miracles happen with a 50/50 Senate and his economic performance on *traditional* metrics is among the best (and certainly not indicative of a one term President). He held the western powers together on Ukraine and had a handful of other foreign policy accomplishments.

Yet for all that; what he will probably be remembered most for was handing the Presidency back to trump and, if the worst case comes to pass, the last semblance of American democracy. 

The Afghanistan withdrawal was a disaster that he never really recovered from. His support for Ukraine was effective, but also very timid. And that hesitation cost Ukraine time and manpower. The 2021 winter Covid spike *somehow* caught his team completely off guard and further damaged his administration's credibility. And his team was simply horrible at messaging and communicating about the economy. Inflation was a global phenomenon; the housing crisis was the result of twenty years of near zero home construction and restrictive local zoning. Yet his team allowed both to define him without ever finding a decent rebuttal.

Biden was great at managing the legislative process 
for thirty-six years in the Senate; he was great at managing the legislative process as Obama's Vice President; and he was great at managing the legislative process as President.

","Biden has given a series of smaller farewell speeches over the week. This evening was the final one. Perhaps, to many this was a fond farewell speech, to some others, just a formal goodbye and to others a ""good riddance"". He touted his economic policies focusing on the Inflation Reduction Act calling it an Investment in American Workers. The greatest investment since the ""New Deal"".  Biden spoke of investment in technology and AI and a 1.3 trillion investment in Defense. Looking to the future he talked about reform in the Supreme Court with accompanying Ethical Standards.  Biden spoke of Democracy and the Statute of Liberty. 

Biden spoke of Amercian strength and resolve and leading the free world, bringing unity in EU and expanding NATO. He expressed that if EU remains united Ukraine can prevail. In the Pacific Biden spoke of new allies and presenting a united front against China. 

Biden also spoke of bringing about a Peace Agreement in the Middle East in coordination with the incoming administration \[since they have to monitor the implementation.\]

Biden did a great job with helping America recover and also deal with new global issues.

Did Biden provide a realistic assessment of his accomplishment?",612,563,49,"There isn’t anything to justify that we are stronger abroad. Biden’s foreign policy was, at best, very ineffectual. Global conditions escalated significantly throughout his term.

* Russia invaded Ukraine and we seem no closer to mediating an end to the war than we were three years ego.
* North Korea is fighting foreign wars for the first time in generations, and relations between them and SK are collapsing.
* Fighting between Israel and Palestine is at its deadliest in their shared history. Biden failed for over a year to mediate a ceasefire, and his role in it finally happening today is debatable given the timing.
* The Abraham Accords are effectively dead. All recent progress in normalizing relations between Israel and the Arab world have been undone.
* The Afghanistan withdrawal will go down as a major embarrassment for the US.

Perhaps the best thing to happen under his term is the fall of Assad, which was ironically largely caused by all the fighting taking place in other areas of the world. Russia and Iran were too busy to support Syria, so it collapsed.",14,2025-01-16 01:19:55,2025-01-16 04:05:52,-0.6

I think his speech was pretty interesting. A lot of the stuff that he brought up (Oligarchs, term limits, wealth inequality, misinfo) should have been a bigger part of their message the last 2 years. They could never make a solid message that got through on any of those items. It was a mishmash.

The big name in this field is the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025.

Conservatives feel that the world is getting away from them, and this is a real problem because in their POV the world has a natural order, it has a way its supposed to be, the change of the times and the culture is literally a bad thing. If there is a God who created all things, including just men and women, then anyone arguing in favor of change is arguing in favor of denying the divinely appointed order of the world. In their perspective change is evil, and those who seek it are at best deluded and foolish and at worst evil and conniving. In their view there is a way the world, and this nation, are supposed to be and that way has been perverted so they are justified in doing anything they can to put the world back to sorts (as they see it). 

They are taking advantage of a once in a lifetime opportunity to tear down the status quo, to shake up political norms, and to yank the Overton Window so far to the right that even if there is a free and fair election of a Democrat in four years it will be impossible to put the puzzle pieces back the way they were. They are realigning the norms of politics and culture through shock therapy knowing that once its done there's almost no chance for it to be undone. Undercutting the ability of the Government to operate, denying civil rights to LGTBQA+ individuals, and firing anyone and everyone who isn't a politicial appointee is all legitimate and justified, they believe, because they are taking this moment to put the world back the way it should be. 

Gays and Trans should know they aren't people and they shouldn't expect to be represented in public. Women should know their place is raising children and that their husbands should make decisions for the family. White Evangelical Christians, the most persecuted people on the planet, should know their interests are protected and their government is looking out for them. There are only Man and Woman and anyone who disagrees is a danger to the community. The Republicans and their enablers are doing their damndest to make sure the world makes sense (to them) again and they'll break any number of laws to do it-- because they are justified and righteous.",46,2025-02-14 11:49:38,2025-02-14 20:51:11,0.9

But we have a president who violates the constitution every single day. If the president doesn’t respect the constitution, then in a way it doesn’t matter what it says. 

The real change needs to be with the Supreme Court. Roberts is a strong believer in the unitary executive theory. Pretty much all the Republican justices are. The Roberts court has whittled away at the constitution for a while now. Beginning with Citizens United and culminating with the Trump immunity case, the presidential office is pretty much that of a king now. Yes presidential power is a major problem but it was SCOTUS who gave the president that power. Also if you look at the rulings, they are aimed primarily at republican presidents. Democratic presidents aren’t entitled to the same authority. Or they might be. The immunity ruling happened during Biden’s term but he was too “noble” or more likely to incompetent to take advantage of it.

The reason for the popular vote margins you point to is usually specific to the election and the state of the Country during that election.  

'92 and '96' Clinton had Ross Perot to eat up a chunk of the electorate both times or else he would have probably won the majority.   

2000:  Gore did win the popular vote, but like Clinton, third parties ate into his margins and frankly, to this day, it's questionable whether he did win Florida given how fucked up their hanging and dimpled chad ballets were.  He probably would have won Florida if people did not accidently vote for Buchannan and if non-felon blacks weren't sent away.  TLDR:  Florida was fucked up and I'm still not convinced Bush really won the state.  

2004:  Bush was still riding his post-9/11 popularity in 2004.  Even the Iraq War and War on Terror were popular during that election.  The Rally Around the Flag effect was real.  Had the election occurred in 2005 or '06, I bet it would have wore off and Kerry would have won.  

2008:  Obama was a great candidate but he was also able to capitalize on the Bush Administrations' unpopularity.  With the Great Recession going on, it was clear that a campaign of ""Hope"" and Change"" was a real winner.  And in 2012, the economy still wasn't wonderful, but it made big strides so Obama was rewarded for it. 

2016:  Clinton in 2016 is really the only head scratcher for me.  But Hillary was historically unpopular and much more of a policy wonk than a charismatic leader who took on a parade of Republican attacks for years along with Russian interference.  Despite all of this, she still won the popular vote my almost 3 million votes.  I believe the main reason Trump won was because he spoke to white working class in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania and just *barely* sneaked out a win there. 

2020:  Biden also was a return to normalcy that the country wanted after Trump's unpopularity and Covid messing with everyone's lives.  

2024:  That all brings us back to Harris in 2024.  Yes, the democratic ticket may have done better if there was a real primary and the winner could separate themselves from Biden.  But that begs the question why Biden was so unpopular in the first place and if *any* democrat could have won.  I just don't think so.  The country, especially working class people who don't pay as much attention to politics and make less money in general, were pissed about the amount of inflation that occurred during the Biden administration.  I feel like people are making that election much more complicated than it actually was. 

Candidate quality does matter.  Just look at 2016.  I believe if Obama was allowed to run he would have crushed Trump.  But it should not be overstated.  I don't think a better Democratic candidate would have won 2024 just because people were pissed about inflation.",159,2024-11-20 18:31:30,2024-11-20 19:43:16,0.0

Obama was a skilled campaigner and orator running at the tail end of an unpopular GOP incumbency, against a nominee who was middling among his base, and his platform was built around speaking to voters' material interests, hence him running away with swing states and taking a few red states with him. This inability to speak to material interests is one of the reasons Clinton and Harris lost.

Biden just happened to be nominated against a historically unpopular incumbent during a pandemic that he was publicly bungling, as every state in the country eased up on voting access in response to it (hence the historical turnout), and scraped by into the presidency. I truly believe Trump would have won reelection in 2020 had it not been for COVID.

",0,0,0,"Class room time is a very limited commodity. If you add something to the curriculum you have to take other things away. Most Americans aren't gun owners nor do most Americans live in a house where there is a gun. For the average American student you would be taking away class time from some other important subject to teach them about guns which they will never own. The message ""don't play with guns"" and ""assume every gun is loaded"" is important but we don't need classrooms set aside to tell kids that. That kind of goes into the ""don't run with sharp objects"" and ""stop drop and role"" category. 

If a student is interested in joining the military or becoming a police officer they will typically receive firearm training there regardless of what is offered in schools. The US is also unlikely to face any homeland invasion which would require a ""total defense"" strategy would be needed.

",0,0,0,"Judging from some other comments you made i realize you want a single firearm safety lecture to be mandatory, i still say that is a bad idea but i will list some reasons:

1) The political backlash won't be worth it. As a country we are so divided over guns it would just cause more political issues than it is worth.

2) To what purpose? A single lecture, even if it is a long one, will barely cover most topics and i don't know if you remember school lectures but at the end only about 10% of the kids will remember anything discussed. It isnt worth the cost or energy for it.

3) Who is doing the lecture? bringing in outside group? what group? do they have a bias? will there be a mandated curriculum? Are you going to get Texas and Vermont to agree to the same standards?

4) Most gun safety is common sense. If someone lacks common sense then no amount of training or lectures will help that situation.

A counter to your final sentence, talking about guns wont suddenly ""encourage"" rebellious thoughts in children. Modern children are surrounded by constant mass shootings and school shootings on the news, popular but violent videogames like call of duty, battlefield, and many others, as well as popular TV shows and movies that feature plenty of violence and gun fights.

",0,0,0,"I’m older than most of you and I can remember when everyone had access to guns. There were war surplus rifles in the sporting goods stores of every department store.
I don’t recall that we had mass shootings. There was always a group of people who thought there were too many guns around, but they were in the minority and not vocal.
This all changed after 1968, and I believe today’s youth are fascinated and obsessed with guns in a way that they weren’t when I was a kid. Maybe it’s due to social media or video games. 
I think it would be good for schools to have classes in the proper use of guns, so that guns are viewed as tools that are potentially lethal. Take the mystery out of guns and they’ll lose that sense of exciting, forbidden fruit that they didn’t have for me but seem to have for today’s youth.

I would include some of the unpleasant but necessary aspects of all firearms. Take the students to a range and fire off a round when they’re not wearing hearing protection. That’s a good way to introduce them to the destructive power of firearms.

I have opposed the complete end of the filibuster because it prevents the GOP from unwinding everything whenever the Republicans win a trifecta.  It is much easier to tear things apart than it is to rebuild them, which ultimately gives the filibuster advantage to Dems.

The Dems blame the filibuster for not getting what they want.  But they forget that the filibuster also helps them to preserve what they already have won.

Modifying it could make sense.  But ending it entirely during this political climate would be a huge mistake.",6,2024-11-05 22:45:41,2024-11-06 06:10:27,0.4

Unrelated, but I think allowing the minority to have the advantage is unfair in other areas. Look at the abortion ballot measure in FL - it won a majority but did not pass because it couldn’t clear 60%. This is striking because the state voted for Trump but the majority also voted to protect abortion rights.

They really were like a dog that caught the car when Roe v Wade was overturned, and I have a feeling there's certain pet issues of theirs that are way better to campaign on but not good to achieve.

If, for example, Russia were to drop a bomb on Berlin or the U.S. on Ottawa, what could we do? How would we even prepare for such a scenario? Are there enough nuclear weapons in other countries to act as a deterrent? And how might other nuclear-armed nations react?

1) Women will decide this election. You'll have a bunch of registered republican women that will vote for Harris, and more unaffiliated women will vote for Harris. More women than men vote.

2) The polls have been wrong. As has come to light the past days, it is likely that pollsters have engaged in some hardcore herding to account / compensate for Trump outperforming polls in that past. But this year, with such a huge turnout, and energized voters - I think the polls will have given republicans a very, very skewed and incorrect image of the real standing. ¨

3) Trump has campaigned too much on illegal immigration. It's a less relevant problem for republican voters that live far away from the border - whereas I think *""the economy""* will be the issue that Trump has correctly campaigned on (ironically, given his ""solutions"" for fixing the economy).

4) Trump has spent too many resources on reaching out to the lowest propensity voters in the nation: Young adult males. He should have done more to win voters. 

So, yeah, I think Harris has this in the bag. 

One of the few ways I can see Trump win this, is if absolute chaos ensues, and there's a huge refusal of certifying results. But if that happens, there will be trouble. Congress handing Trump the presidency would be the very, very worst outcome - probably an event that will trigger national riots never seen before in the modern USA.",19,2024-11-03 14:43:32,2024-11-03 17:28:28,0.6

I really don't get why non-revolutionary leftists are still pushing that rhetoric. They clearly don't understand the rules of the great game they are forced to be a part of, whether they like it or not.

Primary challenges like Zohran Mamdani in NYC are a possible avenue, but you need candidates to step up for that. How is it that Hakeem Jeffries gets to hold his safe seat completely unopposed since 2013? Something is clearly wrong there.

I don't think a lot is going to change though. As you've correctly pointed out, Israel is a geopolitical partner of the US. On the opposing side, Hamas and Hezbollah are geopolitical partners of Iran. From a coldhearted geostrategic view, the US have no reason to do anything about this genocide because their position in the region actually stands to benefit from Palestine getting wiped off the map. Wouldn't be the first time that millions of people died in the Middle East for the benefit of the US...

So there are a couple of elements at play here. I'm in the US so I can't speak 100% to the AFD, maybe someone more German can handle that.

Within the US context there's a couple of factors. One is that a lot of the Republican party is made up of Evangelical Christians and it's a huge component of Evangelical Christianity that there is a biblical prophecy that says that Israel has to rebuild the Temple of Solomon and possess all of the Holy Land and that will then go towards triggering the end times which means that Jesus returns. I get that this sounds bonkers but this is a big chunk of why so many Republicans support Israel.

Another component is that Israel is our only staunch ally in the region (I would personally argue that that's not true at all and that Israel is not an ally but that's for another thread) and a way for us to pursue our geopolitical interests in the region from a friendly position. It's geopolitically advantageous to the US to have Israel where it is and thus Republicans support it.

It's also not wild for antisemites to be very pro-Israel. The British were wildly antisemtic (some would argue still are) and one of the motivations for supporting the early Zionist movement was specifically so that British Jews would ""self deport"" to Israel. The idea is ""we can't kill them because people get upset but if we can just get them to go away, that's good enough."" 

Plus there's the factor of antisemties often also being anti-Arab/Muslim and seeing Israelis as bad but at least better than Arabs/Muslims and they want Israel as a way to fight against Muslims in the region.",21,2025-01-11 23:27:38,2025-01-12 02:48:28,0.5

Trump isn't a force of nature, and the executive brand taking more and more power isn't some sort of natural course of action.

Left wing and right wing presidents have respected the power that they have and worked within it. Most have pushed against it to try to get as much done as possible but respected when the courts or Congress said ""no"".  

There have been times in history when presidents didn't respect the courts, like Andrew Jackson did for at least one ruling and a few Congressional resolutions, mostly because he had a deep deep hatred for native Americans.

To hand wave what he's doing as inevitable is stupid. He didn't have to do this, he chose to do this, people choose to back him up. These are real people making these decisions. It's not the weather.

Trump is also not only doing things to hurt the left, he's hurting everyone with most of his orders. It's just only the left that is willing to fight it. It's a shame that people on the right think that makes it an attack on us.

It is bizarre that Western governments would ever recognize a state partly governed by an armed terrorist group, with a constitutional objective to commit Jewish genocide and fight western values abroad, that will also never hold democratic elections.

Some Western governments made promises to placate their left wing political allies that make up an element of their governing coalition (Canada, for instance), or to rally flailing left wing / Muslim support (France has a fragile minority government).

Australia is an exception. They don't even have conditions. They are just taking Abbas at his word, and none of his promises for the Palestinian Territories (both Gaza and West Bank) will come to pass save one (ending pay to slay payments): 

> major new commitments from the Palestinian Authority, including to reform governance, terminate prisoner payments, institute schooling reform, demilitarise and hold general elections.

Meaning they're not stuck with a two party system and/or in gerrymandered or propaganda hell.

Like you said, democracy only works with an informed populace so education, especially a well funded public education system is important. 

Democracy doesn't work when the political party in power does the things above. Cutting public education spending, gerrymandering to ensure they do not lose, only two parties to vote for so there is not really a choice, getting help from corporate media to propagandise the population for their unpopular agenda. Just to name a few.

Working democracies, the enviable ones, usually do not have any of these. They have a strong public education system, they have a publicly funded news broadcaster, they have an independent body that draws up electoral districts and they've usually moved on from first past the post to something better like proportional representation or ranked choice voting.

Other problems I'd consider problematic. Is money = speech and insider trading. The capture of government by corporate interests/lobbyists. 

Just to address the benevolent dictator thing. A lot of people seem to want a benevolent dictator because they think it would allow one person to do a lot of good. I don't think it's a good idea because if history is anything to learn from, there has been more dictators that killed many people than benevolent dictators.

When I go to Barnes and Noble nowadays, however, those types of stories are fewer and not catered towards young boys and men. The fantasy section went from being half of an aisle growing up to now a single shelf or two in most bookstores. And those sections are a mixed bag, because those spaces have rightfully had more entry by authors that concentrate on female protagonists. The issue isn't the entry of those stories, but that the reduction in space combined with their entry led to less available stories that a young man can easily relate to.

I'm not saying that the introduction of female stories is an issue or that the economics don't make sense for the publishing houses, since on average girls do read more. I'm saying that today, a young boy who dreams of being the hero has to work fairly hard to walk into a store and find the type of media that'll speak to him. 

The only place to find those kinds of stories easily that is left is video games, and video game companies have been pushing for decades to ensure multiplayer is the key aspect of new games (think shooters). So young boys and men don't have a space to form their own opinions through an intimate interaction with a story, they're subjected to the group interpretation right off the bat. And that group is trending right.",9,2024-11-15 18:36:03,2024-11-17 18:11:08,-0.4
PoliticalDiscussion,controversial,Are US media companies neglecting young men in their messaging? Could this contribute to their shift toward right-wing culture?,"In recent years, I've noticed that there’s been a noticeable shift in the cultural and political landscape, particularly among young men. Some argue that media companies—whether through television, movies, or video games—have deprioritized messaging and content specifically aimed at this demographic. Instead, they seem to focus on broader or more inclusive storytelling, which, while important, may have inadvertently left certain groups feeling alienated.

This raises some interesting questions:

1. Are media companies consciously avoiding content that appeals to traditional notions of masculinity or to the interests of young men?

2. If so, could this lack of representation or targeted messaging be driving some young men toward spaces, personalities, and movements that emphasize masculinity in more traditional or politicized ways—such as those associated with right-wing culture?

3. Could this be part of a broader cultural trend where young men feel overlooked or even vilified, leading them to embrace ideologies that claim to address these grievances?",10,5,5,"Absolutely. As a anti child abuse activist and author I did a lot of work for a number of years tracking down abuse victims and getting their stories told and the media regularly ignores boys and men even though they are the ones that are incarcerated the most and that was the topic; abused youth formerly incarcerated. The lack of empathy, sympathy, and compassion for men and boys is a direct result of the MSM's complacancy in the efforts of Feminsts to silence men and boys and victims of abuse that may have a woman as perpatrator. This has led many young men, myself included, to denounce femininsm in its entirety as a movement as it has propped up and defended famous abusers, rapists, DV monsters like Amber Heard, Katy Perry, and Cardi B just to name a few. Coupled with the medias constant demonization of men, fathers, and males in society in general, they refuse to address issues important to us for fear the feminists will be enraged and their ratings will plummet. Ratings = ad income. Its all about selling the damsel in distress not covering actual statistics and data and the whole scope of the problem. When we include prison rapes men are actually raped more than women in this country. 2/3 of your homeless are men. 2/3 of your shelters and resources for that problem are for women and children. 93% of your adult prisoners are men. 88% of the juveniles we lock up are boys. Boys are committing suicide 5x the rate of girls and men 4x the rate of women and that increases yearly that suicide gap as we call it. 83% of parents with custody of their children are women aka mothers. These means that only 17% of the time do fathers actually have any say in their children's life legally and makes them easy to manipulate and exploit financially, emotionally, and otherwise. Since about 1995 we've had clear data year after year from the US Census stating that DV is about equal among the genders. This meaning neither men nor women are inherently more violent in relationships. But thats not what your TV tells you is it? Thats not what your feminist friends tell you is it? The data is there but you are being lied to and people are eating it up. In fact women are charged 1/3 as much as men in this country and do on average 1/3 as much time for the same crimes according BOP. So we have a lack of accountability for Parent Alienators, who cause men to kill themselves at alarming rates since 2/3 of those who are alienated will seriously ponder suicide. We have women who hit men in public and its funny and people laugh. We have boys who grow up internalizing this message they are toxic, violent, horrible monsters that need to be controlled yet nobody is listening to them about their needs, when they are abused, when they need support. MeToo wasn't for men or boys or abused people without a vagina. So ya that def is part of it and we've been screaming that but you know. Keep doing what you do.

",0,0,0,"From the average person on the street acting in self-defense? I don't think so. Although I think that there were some issues with how Penny handled it (e.g., maintaining chokehold after Neely went limp and after another subway rider came up to help restrain him), there was still some room for reasonable doubt there. I don't know how much since I'm not familiar with the nitty gritty.

But I do think that, in general, the police may have a higher burden to act responsibly, at least from an ethical standpoint. Or that, perhaps, in situations like this it may be better to dispatch a social worker to help as well that may be able to talk someone down. It's hard to say what the answer is, universally, but I think that ""when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail"" is at times true for police when it comes to handling mental health episodes which could have more peaceable solutions.

Protected?

As in defended from those.....defending themselves or others from bodily harm?

People having manic episodes don't have to be protected *if they don't threaten other people with bodily harm*.

This is a one way street. The ***first*** person that threatens or employs bodily harm is called ""The Aggressor"". 

The door is opened. NOW begins the defensive use of force and ends with the end of the ability to offer violent harm from the ""The Agressor"".

The Agressor does not get to claim defense *from defense*. The Agressor is entirely capable of avoiding violent harm by NOT becoming the Aggressor.

Although they are often conflated in today's media, they are not related.

The immigration system itself operates smoothly, with millions of people legally entering the country each year. However, border security is about preventing unauthorized entry and protecting the nation’s borders, not about managing immigration. Yes, many people arrive at the border daily, but that does not constitute immigration.

Immigration is a legal, documented process where individuals are granted permission to enter the country ""before"" doing so. If you show up at the border, you are required to go through a designated port of entry and present your documentation to see if you are allowed to enter. Anyone who bypasses this process is breaking the law and faces immediate deportation or even possibly jail time before being deported.

To illustrate, imagine returning home to find a family living in your house. They think your home is better than theirs, they can't afford their own, or think you just have better food and beds. Would you let them stay, feed, and clothe them like part of your family, or would you call the police and have them removed for squatting?

While the moral complexities of those arriving at the border are important, many are fleeing persecution and seeking asylum, this process must be properly verified. Additionally, international asylum protocols require that asylum seekers file their claims for asylum in the first country they enter, rather than passing through multiple countries to reach their preferred destination. By traveling through other nations to get to the U.S. they are violating these international protocols. Meaning they have violated asylum protocols and we should not be grant them asylum.

According to the World Bank about ""3.6 Billion"" people in the world live on less than $5.50 a day, poverty level, how many of them should we let in?",3,2025-01-05 20:32:54,2025-01-06 18:04:30,-0.9

The problem Harris faced was two very different stances in the Democratic Party voters on the subject.

At one end of the spectrum, are a bunch of Democrats that have always supported Israel and at the other end, the people who demanded the party cut Israel off completely for its actions in Gaza.

I suspect if she had said she was going to boycott Israel at that time, she'd probably have lost by a slightly larger margin, or it would have been about the same.

Liberals, which include the majority of Democrats, are not protesting. Democrats are traditionally pro-deportation of undocumented immigrants with criminal records. The #s of deportations that occurred under Clinton, Obama, and Biden back that up. Democrats are also not passionate enough to warrant taking to the streets. 

The reason that people are upset with this administration regarding immigration is twofold: 

1. The people being arrested and deported are seemingly not receiving due process. For all we know, they are deporting a lot of innocent people. The Constitution is crystal clear and has been confirmed by SCOTUS that ALL PEOPLE, not just citizens, are entitled to due process under the 4th and 14th amendments. There would be no protests if we were sure that each of these people got their day in court with proper representation. 
2. Deporting people still doesn't fix the immigration issue. It is simply treating the symptoms instead of the root cause. Congress needs to pass comprehensive immigration reform that directly addresses the main issues. Biden (regardless if you like him or not), was clear that he would sign a bill after it passes Congress.",54,2025-06-10 19:27:14,2025-06-10 19:38:02,0.4

If the government can make advocating for policies they don't approve of illegal then you don't have a democracy.

A family member who criticizes another family members viewpoints on a subject (any subject) over Thanksgiving Dinner is not violating anyone's freedom of speech.

For example, bringing up hate speech concerning Charlie Kirk is misleading and inaccurate. 

Hate speech is directed at classes of people without regard for their personhood and individuality. Hate speech can target gays, blacks, women, could target men or whites too—whole classes of people being threatened by generally directed hate. An obvious precursor to violent persecution.

Charlie Kirk is an individual and as a public figure is an appropriate target for political and personal opinions. While it is appropriate to condemn political violence, commentators can also welcome the loss of Charlie Kirk without engaging in hate speech.

Condemning an individual for their speech and actions is not hate speech, it’s personal judgment.

Idk why you democrats are so dense. It's basic human psychology to be seen and heard. Y'all are so stupid sometimes....

Just a little something for young men to let them know ""Boys, we hear you. We understand that there's a lot going on in our lives and we need some help. We will make sure you get the support and help you need. I've needed help before to get through some tough shit, and I'm going to make sure you get the support you need to get through some tough shit together. You are worth it.""

At least have that to reach out to men. Democrats are doing nothing to win votes, they are always assuming people will vote for them. They are openly letting Republicans recruit young men!!!!!

The truth is reputation proceeds all else. Democrats, liberals, and progressives are perceived to ignoring men. The online left sucks at messed up the democrat's image on men for decades. Democrats need to actively oppose this to show people that men ARE included in progress to! Don't be afraid to get canceled by terminally online leftists.

We can have both empathy for men and women. We have space in our hearts for men, women, Palestine, North Carolina, etc. sometimes leftists get too much into a suffering measuring contest.....

Strong men can create great times. But strong men can also create the worsts of time if misguided. It is possible to reach out to men. Y'all are just too stubborn and given up on rehabilitation.

It's contextual you have to see the history of it. There were no treaties on bombing and bombing proponents thought, logically, hit the enemy hard and destroy their capacity to wage war and this will end the war quicker and ultimately save lives. See Bomber Harris. This wasn't correct but it was a POV. 

Japan knew it was losing but wanted better surrender terms. They had a million veteran troops on their main islands and had prepared defensive positions. Japan thought, not unreasonably, that if they inflict heavy casualities on an American invasion, America would have to offer terms such as, no occupation, no foreign war crimes trials, no loss of Korea or Formosa. Some American war games of invasion of Japan show it failing. Japan expected an American invasion Fall of 1945. 

Japan knew Soviet Union wouid invade. They had plans to fall back to Korea. War with the Soviet Union, leveling and burning of Japanese cities, and starvation with submarine blockade was something the Japanese were prepared to accept until the American invasion. If it failed or even if the Americans took great casualities, the Americans would have to give up on unconditional surrender. 

Towards the end of the war fire-bombing killed more people (both in Germany and Japan) than Hiroshima and Nagasaki. There's horrible stories of civilians fleeing the fire and getting stuck in the street asphalt which was melting. Or fleeing into a river that would boil. 

US Air force thought the atomic bomb was a more humane weapon than fire bombing. They also thought it might give Japan an excuse to surrender with face. It kinda did as the Emperor in his surrender speech mentioned the weapon and Japan's decision to surrender was to save mankind. 

It took the personal intervention of the Japanese Emperor to engage Japanese surrender. And even then, after two atomic bombs, many Japanese Army didn't want to surrender. There was a coup attempt in the last hours. So even after dropping two Atomic bombs, Japanese surrender was a close-run thing.",28,2024-11-17 22:53:40,2024-11-18 00:52:18,0

What do you think?",0,0,0,"No, at least not strictly in the lens of what was categorized as a war crime in 1945. At the time the broad international law defining war crimes were the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 which did prohibit civilian targeting by artillery but not aircraft. The modern Geneva Convention did not come into force until after WW2 (although it too was an amendment to an earlier, narrow agreement reached following WW1).


Some early opponents of the bombings pointed out that the U.S. would have charged Germany or Japan of war crimes under novel legal theories had they carried out the bombings and lost, notably existing laws prohibiting genocide. These arguments fail to account for the fact that both Germany and Japan were already guilty of genocide which allowed us broad authority to prosecute anyone who was aware of the genocide and prolonged the war. The bombings themselves did not constitute genocide as they were broadly targeted at the enemy rather than a specific group.",3,2024-11-17 22:53:40,2024-11-18 07:54:05,0

Some nba stars have been widely panned on reddit for expressing certain positive views about China or Saudi Arabia. 

How strong is the USA's argument for moral superiority?",0,0,0,"I think your question is loaded. Moral superiority depends what you consider moral and exactly that's where the difference is in the countries you mentioned. Saudi Arabia views the way we allow porn and violence on TV, the music we listen to and letting women walk around with so much flesh visible morally corrupt. China focuses more on the benefits for the community and the respect of elders and views the way we treat our old people despicable. 

From a Western moral point of view, the US is miles ahead of both states. As an inheritor of European culture, if you debate the morality by European standards, you'll find that certain countries focus on different aspects. The US focuses on individual liberty while Germany for example focuses on risk minimization by collective action. It's hard to debate who is ""morally superior"" in that context. 

The issue starts when you start treating Saudi Arabian moral code as equal to Western moral code or you lean into ""being superior"" because of your moral code. Both paths are wrong in my view. If you equalize their moral code you are essentially giving up your own moral code without replacing it. If you act as if you were superior, people will pick up on your haughty behavior and you essentially do nothing else except telling the others what they are doing wrong the whole day - hardly a way to inspire change. That's what the people being upset about the comedians going to Saudi Arabia are about.",17,2025-10-12 04:14:46,2025-10-12 12:16:40,0

But there's a lot of people for whom hating the US has become their entire personalities, and they get a little bit ridiculous when twisting themselves into pretzels to try and  equate the US and places like China and Saudi Arabia. It's disingenuous and frankly childish. 

You know you're getting bleedover from the ""weird"" parts of Reddit when people start asking, ""what good is democracy if going to the doctor costs money?"" and making pseudo-academic comparisons to the ""American empire."" 

At the end of the day, the US *at least tries* to be a platform of personal liberty, civil rights, democracy and the free market. It doesn't always succeed (and sometimes fails horrifically), but it holds those things to be goals and aspirations.

I say it's more sensible to judge the ""morality"" of a country in terms of how it treats those it has sworn to protect. In the US you can criticize the government and say what jokes you want without government reprisal. That's not true in Saudi Arabia or China. Those comedians who joked about American ""censorship"" had to sign contracts not to joke about religion, the royal family or the Saudi government. Conservatives want to confuse government censorship and public backlash  as the same thing when it isn't. Getting cancelled is not a government act and it doesn't reflect the moral station of the government the same way as if the government was directly ordering censorship.

**Extreme One**

> Trump faces no practical limitations anymore. He will be able to stack every facet of the government with sufficient loyalists that he will be able to do literally anything he wants. If he wants to, he could force everyone to hang a painting of himself in their house and have them executed if the painting is damaged.

There will be sham elections in which Trump receives 100% of the vote every time while simultaneously anyone who votes against Trump is literally thrown to a pack of wolves to be ripped apart.

**Middle Position**

> Trump will face some obstacles in trying to implement loony policies. The SCOTUS/Congress/Military would prevent him from mandating really horrifying stuff like what is being suggested above. That being said, many of his policies, such as abolishing the Department of Education, imposing tariffs, and so on, will sail on through. There could be fair and free elections in the future.

**Extreme Two**

> Trump will be a far right president, but nothing more. Democracy will survive, even if Democrats will have a whole lot to complain about. Perhaps the federal bureaucracy is turned to Trump's whims, perhaps it's not; but we will have the rule of law, and we will have fair and free elections moving forward.

> Trump will face some obstacles in trying to implement loony policies. The SCOTUS/Congress/Military would prevent him from mandating really horrifying stuff like what is being suggested above. That being said, many of his policies, such as abolishing the Department of Education, imposing tariffs, and so on, will sail on through. There could be fair and free elections in the future.

**Extreme Two**

> Trump will be a far right president, but nothing more. Democracy will survive, even if Democrats will have a whole lot to complain about. Perhaps the federal bureaucracy is turned to Trump's whims, perhaps it's not; but we will have the rule of law, and we will have fair and free elections moving forward. If a Republican loses in 2028, then a Democrat will become president.

How likely are each of these three positions to occur? Are all of them incorrect? What alternative positions are there to take?

**EDIT: In light of Trump drafting an Executive Order specifically to purge the military of ""woke"" generals and admirals, it looks like Extreme One is the clear favorite.**",447,295,152,"Probably pretty unlikely due to his own incompetence, penchant for invoking intense political backlash and also the enormous amount of power that is in the hands of the states rather than the federal government",49,2024-11-11 22:28:38,2024-11-11 23:40:17,0.5

In socially-progressive countries like in Europe, immigration is notoriously difficult, because there’s no way you can offer free healthcare and retirement benefits to everyone who wants it by nature of an easy immigration system.

Countries like Canada have a bit of a tiered immigration system. It’s hard to immigrate, unless you’re a fairly well-off student or professional worker who can pay to get work authorization, and don’t need government subsidies. It’s a very different paradigm than in the US where many low-income people are crossing the border.

I’m of the belief that if any rich country, such as the US, had a libertarian immigration system then it would absolutely be abused to the point of failure by anyone looking to come there for work.

Immigrants here for labor should pay taxes, though probably at a lower rate as they don’t enjoy full use of state services. We should take better care to ensure student and worker visas do not discourage companies/schools from taking on citizens or incentivize depressing wages for locals. Worker visas should go to the far ends of employment: work that it’s hard to find people with the right skillset, or work that citizens don’t want to do. 

There should be much stricter enforcement against businesses hiring illegal workers, and apartments renting to them. Owners and landlords should themselves be fined and charged for breaking migration law. Policy should be changed to require that a potential refugee stay and gain asylum in the first safe country, not use asylum in order to economically migrate. 

For people who would be citizens in the West, they need to demonstrate appreciation for western values. This includes tolerance of people of different sex, race and religion, not mistreating people on the basis of their sex, embracing freedom of speech, and, because the Paradox of Tolerance is a thing, people who oppose the West, or practice some form of religious or cultural practice incompatible with western values, should not be allowed.

Migration and granting citizenship is a privilege, not a right. At least in the West, there are literally billions who would like to be here. We should be more discerning on who we place in the front of the line. Absolutely we should take in people from the global south, who are worse off, in many cases from the excesses of actions in previous centuries. But we live as if in a lifeboat, and citizens will not tolerate taking on more migrants that they feel they can handle, or voters will move in a rightward direction, which helps neither migrants nor the nation, often. So, a country does best on migration policy when it uses law and law enforcement to ensure migrants are either legitimately refugees, or are coming in to bring real benefit to the nation, and in either case that they will preferably integrate to the local norms and culture, or at a minimum are not hostile to the same.",10,2025-04-14 03:13:03,2025-04-14 03:40:00,-0.8

Cities and their suburbs, traditionally Democratic strongholds, have begun voting more Republican too.

Trump is a political anomoly, and even the most MAGA-loyal republicans will have a time of it trying to replicate his success with him no longer part of the political equation.",11,2025-02-08 16:58:01,2025-02-09 13:45:28,0.4
PoliticalDiscussion,controversial,How will the increasing diversity in the Republican voter base impact its future?,"Trump's voter base in 2024 was more diverse than many people expected, with many key groups like Black Americans, Latinos, Asians, and Jews shifting to the right politically. College educated people and young men have also shifted to the right. They didn’t all go for Trump overall but they still shifted to the right compared to previous years. 

Cities and their suburbs, traditionally Democratic strongholds, have begun voting more Republican too. This could be important as rural America is shrinking quickly and more people are flocking to urban and suburban areas. By 2050, 89% of the American population is projected to live in urban/suburban areas, up from 83% right now. I think these are things that could shape what the Republican Party becomes in the future and what their priorities are.

The archetype of a Republican voter has traditionally been an older white person from a rural area. But as time goes on, this could change.

We don’t know if these changes are only for 2024 or if it’s a broader trend that will be more permanent. Since these groups may become a bigger part of the Republican electorate, how do you think this will affect the future of conservative politics in the United States if it kept going this direction? Would this curb the influence of far right extremist groups like White nationalists?

Also, despite the increased racial diversity, two groups that shifted further away from Republicans were women and the LGBTQ community, so it will be interesting to see how that develops. I wonder if the divide will shift from race to more about sexuality

They have picked up more skin tnes, but it's almost impossible to find a college graduate in the party anymore. The last time I looked, the biggest statistical predictor of if you're a Trump supporter anymore is level of education - the less you have, the more likely you are to support him (and it really is his party now). Anyone who knows anything about science, or medicine, or economics, or history, or really anything has run screaming from the party. They have opposed education on pretty much every level for decades, and they are reaping the ""rewards"". Sure, it's destroying the nation, but whatever. This is pretty much always the go-to move for any authoritarian movement because the less you know, the more easily you are played. And now they've finally reached the point where they can openly move to completely eliminate the Dept of Education. Now the red states, which already generally have terrible schools, in large part because they also tend to be the poor states, would now not get any federal money, thus making their population even more poorly educated, and consequently even more easily manipulated. 

This is going to be horrific. 

So, again, I think the whole ""diversity"" thing is overplayed. Things come down to policies. The less knowledge you have, the more likely you are to be convinced to vote for policies which tend to be bad for the common man. Red states already tend to have the worst stats on pretty much every level and it's going to get worse.",12,2025-02-08 16:58:01,2025-02-09 08:48:12,0.9

Or should the people be responsible for themselves without government help?

Should the government collect taxes, and then use them on a national level to improve the lives of all the citizens? That is the liberal view. This leads to national parks, national health standards, national infrastructure, a central government that is used for the benefit of all citizens. I think of this as the Christian view: the meek shall inherit the earth, feed the poor, what you have done to the least of us you have done to all of us; we are all in this together.

The conservative view is that people are responsible for themselves, there should be no national ""nanny"" government. People rise to their level based on their own efforts, their own talents. This leads to no national infrastructure, no taxing of some in order to help others. This was made explicit with the Confederacy: only state level infrastructure, no national conscription for national armies, no central government at the national level to look after the welfare of all citizens. This is the Old Testament view: the strong shall rule over the weak, the rich don't pay taxes to feed the poor.

Today, the conservatives are trying to dismantle the American government; disband the Post Office, disband the Dept of Education and FEMA and let the states handle it. Sell nationally owned land to the states or private interests. Privatize Social Security, the government collecting taxes and then disbursing it to all citizens is a liberal concept, conservatives call it communism and want to abolish it. The central government should not be in the business of running things.

So is it going to be the Old Testament way of ""an eye for an eye"", or should that tradition be replaced with ""turn the other cheek and love your enemies""? Should the strong rule the weak or should the meek and humble inherit the earth? Do you help the stranger or turn him away? Are all people equal and deserve equal treatment, or do some deserve special treatment and position based on their personal situation?

The U.S. has a strong tradition of **laissez faire capitalism**. Think of certain customs, institutions, and laws during the Gilded Age, the Roaring 20s, and the Reaganite 80s.

The U.S. also has a strong tradition of **regulated capitalism**. Think of certain customs, institutions, and laws during the Progressive Era, the Great Depression, and the Stormy 60s.

Both capitalist traditions sometimes conflict with each other, recommending incompatible courses of action. For example, in certain cases, **laissez faire capitalism** recommends weaker labor laws, while **regulated capitalism** recommends stronger labor laws.

Besides capitalism, there are other examples of conflicting traditions. Consider, for instance, conflicting traditions over immigration and race.

Now, a conservative tries to preserve traditions and make changes on the basis of traditions. How, then, should a conservative decide between conflicting traditions? Which traditions should they try to preserve, or use as the basis of change, when such traditions come into conflict?

Should they go with the older tradition? Or the more popular tradition? Or the more consequential tradition? Or the more beneficial tradition? Or the tradition most coherent with the government’s *original* purpose? Or the tradition most coherent with the government’s *current* purpose?

So in short, your question is as timely as the proper etticut of two horse-drawn carriages meeting at an intersection.  

To tackle the ivory tower question: conservativism should be inclined to preserve traditions, but not fully bound by them.  It is, in theory a pragmatic philosophy.  Take time to evaluate changes before making them, and make them intentionally based on a desired outcome.  Typically the desired outcome has been articulated as economic growth, but it could also be more or less wealth inequality or greatest happiness or any number of other goals.

The more you think like this, the less conservative you become. 

A lot of modern American conservative thought is “because I said so”. Imagine the GOP as a boomer parent talking to a young teen. 

“Why do tax cuts for the rich help the middle class?” 

“Because I said so.”

“How do we know climate change isn’t real, and that our actions affect it?”

“Because I said so.”

“Why is the COVID vaccine more harmful than it is helpful?”

“Because I said so.”

Each of these things can be easily disproven. When people start to think about their beliefs, they start to research, and begin to get a clearer picture of how the world really works. I’m not saying the left is always right- *they’re not.* 

What I’m saying is that a lot of the backbone thoughts in American conservatism are not realistic. It’s no coincidence that conspiracy theories run rampant on the right. Life experience and education (whether self or otherwise), shows that a lot of this stuff just isn’t realistic.",4,2025-02-19 06:36:56,2025-02-19 14:34:00,0.85

It died during Trump's first term.

Modern American conservatism started in 1980 with Ronald Reagan and ended in 2016 following Trump's victory. This brand of conservatism had a few core ideas such as:

* Being fiscally conservative

* Pro-business/anti-unions

* Deregulation and tax cuts benefit the American economy

* America is a power for good in the world and it's hegemony must be maintained

* America must project power to protect American interests and values around the world

* America is an exceptional country whose history, ideals, and traditions must be 
cherished and preserved

* Christian values (especially on social issues) should be secularized and turned into law

There's more to it, but you get the gist. This brand of conservatism was seen as something very rational, and the people who supported it saw themselves as the ""adults"" in the room. The narrative was that as people aged and got more experienced and wisdom, they would come to realize that conservatism was ultimately right.

This type of conservatism no longer exists. The last presidential candidate to be a true conservative was Mitt Romney in 2012. Around 2015/2016 these conservatives made a bet on Trump, thinking that he would represent their beliefs... but they ended up being wrong.

Trump in his first term made it very apparent that he was not a conservative nor did he care about conservatism. He didn't care about business, America's role in the world, the constitution, Christian values, balancing the budget, or anything conservatism believed in. A lot of them quickly figured out that Trump is a threat to their brand of politics and started opposing him, however, this resulted in Trump labeling them as RINOs and subsequently purging them from the Republican party.

As Trump slowly but surely squeezed the legacy conservatives out of the GOP, he replaced them with MAGA loyalists. Unlike the conservatives who had principles and values that they believed in, MAGA had nothing. They believed in nothing and they stood for nothing. They only exist to appease Trump. What was left of the GOP, both the base and the politicians, were opportunists who sucked up Trump to advance their political careers/interests and MAGA loyalists who will follow Trump no matter what.

The legacy conservatives became politically homeless, and their squeeze was finalized in 2021 when Mike Pence in his last days in office, took a stand against Trump to protect the country from his attempted coup. Pence's defiance by choosing the country and his prinicples over Trump, was the final nail in the coffin. It was guaranteed at that point, that if Trump ever got back into the white house, he will exclusively only select diehard loyalists to appoint or back for anything... which is where we are now.

Which bring us to today. What do conservatives today stand for? Nobody knows. Why? It's because they stand for nothing. American conservatism today is literally just the whims of a senile 78 year old Trump. His words and actions define conservatism no matter how wrong, how irrational, how obscene, or how contradictory they are. Since MAGA are blindly faithful, American conservatism today acts like a religion but without any substance. In other words, a cult. 

The sliver lining here is this, there will be no MAGA controlled GOP post Trump. Since MAGA's one and only central belief is following Trump no matter what, it will live and die with Trump. At the same time, conservatism from the Reagan Era is officially dead and will never come back. What this means is that either in 2028 or whenever Trump dies, we will have a new brand of American conservatism. Since the Democrats are going through a similar transformation right now, that means we're about to enter a new era of American politics in a few years.",4,2025-02-19 06:36:56,2025-02-19 12:00:06,0.7

Who is right?",2,1,1,"Both; the left-right political spectrum is primarily economic, not social. 

Ultimately, the Democratic Party has suffered because they’re now seen as a big HR department that is primarily concerned with (often petty) social grievances; this extends to the image of democratic voters as a whole. Some time ago, they were seen as the party of working folks: minimum wage, consumer protections, unions, & all of the other “left-wing” policies defined the party. Now, not so much. Also, it doesn’t help that the party serving “regular workin’ folks” often rubs shoulders with wealthy Hollywood figures and receives plenty of “financial support” from the very people & corporations they claim to fight against for their sake. 

The odd thing, however, is that they generally continue to support those policies while the GOP opposes them entirely. The GOP also benefits from being held to a far lower standard when it comes to their extremely wealthy donor base; the propaganda is fine tuned to the point that their voters believe largely harmful policies that benefit those very wealthy people are actually good for them. The fact that they were able to push a message that said a self-proclaimed billionaire teamed up with the world’s richest man to fight the globalist elites like Soros, while also naming extremely wealthy individuals as cabinet nominees (including a former Soros Fund Management partner for Treasury Secretary), is a testament to their talents in this regard; I truly believe it will be studied for generations in academic spheres. 

A lot of this is about image, not policy. Democrats need to roll back the “woke” social rhetoric & focus on economic policy if they hope to survive; in terms of policy, more New Deal & less Third Way would also do some good.

Also, for the love of all that is good & holy, stop involving pop culture figures/celebrities in your campaigns; don’t bring them on stage, don’t hype up their endorsements, just leave them out of it.

3) modernize their campaigns: this is a big reason  the GOP won: they targeted social media advertising that struck an emotional chord with various demographics. The ads had big lies  (i.e., telling those who worked in the oil industry that Harris was anti-fracking when she was not) but they sent the right message to the right groups.

Basically, the Democrats need to be willing to fight dirty if they really want to win -- at least up their game when it comes to digital marketing because that is how people get their info. now, not on mainstream news sites and programming. I am an independent (former Democrat) and I can't tell you how annoying Harris and Walz's cutesy ads online asking for more money got: tell me what you stand for and how you'll make my life better (policy) and tell me why you're different/better than the GOP candidates. But no, they just want money -- in no way, shape or form will that win voters over. Big fail on the Democrats' part.
Until they change tactics they will continue to lose.",4,2024-12-23 20:32:03,2024-12-26 22:26:03,0.5

Joe Biden has been a very progressive President despite running as a moderate for most of his career and in 2020. He has actually brought progressive ideals more mainstream for the broader Democratic party than anyone in my lifetime. 

You have very loud, angry people on the left for whom literally no one but Bernie Sanders is left enough (despite Kamala's very progressive voting record they condemned her as a moderate) and you have the American public who is mostly checked out of politics and is afraid of far-left boogie men.

A moderate Democrat can win and be liked, like Obama, but they have to really seem committed to providing people with a clear narrative of change and authenticity. Harris was a “pragmatist” who was co-sponsoring legislation with Bernie in the Senate in 2017 before moving to the right of Biden on issues like tax policy and fracking by 2024. She was asked what she would do differently than Biden multiple times and didn’t have clear answers. She didn’t seem authentic or committed to changing the system. 

Both the Trump and Harris campaign agreed that their data showed trans rights as an issue wasn’t really swaying voters they targeted.

He led the country through its darkest time, the Civil War, and held everything together when it easily could have fallen apart.

His leadership was steady, thoughtful, and driven by a deep sense of moral duty, which isn’t something you see in every leader.

I obviously wasn’t around during Lincoln’s time, but his impact is still everywhere today. If we’re talking more recent leaders, FDR is another strong pick. He got the U.S. through the Great Depression and World War II, and his New Deal policies changed the way the government helps people.

I think that's a pretty shallow bit of political analysis. It's simultaneously true while being almost completely unhelpful. The problem isn't *that* we're divided, it's what we're divided *about*. And the main problem is that most people don't clearly understand what the division is. Which prevents us from talking about it, let alone resolving it.

In a nutshell, one side of American politics has formed around a decades-long backlash against the progress made by blacks and women in the 1960s and 70s. The modern Republican Party has since that time been against just about every policy that might benefit average Americans...because now it includes them. And a large swath of white America decided to drain the pool and fill it in permanently rather than swim with their black neighbors. (H/T Heather McGhee) This is the reason why we don't have nice things like healthcare and livable wages and all the rest of the things other wealthy democracies seem to have.

Trump is just the last gasp of people tired of seeing their preferred social order eroded decade after decade. Specifically, white supremacy and misogyny and homophobia. MAGA is nothing more than a desire to return to a time when straight white men controlled everything, women and people of color knew their places, and the LGBTQ folks were invisible.

And some of us want this so badly that we're willing to cast aside democracy itself in order to achieve it.

We don't need to reduce partisanship. We have to confront the division for what it is, and decide things one way or the other permanently.",3,2025-01-27 00:28:44,2025-01-27 21:07:26,0.9

Conflict over values, interests, and resources does that. Strong allegiance to a party/ideology does not preclude seeking common ground. Consider the era from 1963-1973. 

1) There was intense ""us against them"" thinking during that decade on race relations. And yet our government passed the Civil Rights Act, the Fair Housing Act, and the Voting Rights Act. 

2) There was intense partisanship in the elections that brought Nixon to power. And yet it was bi-partisan Senate Committee that unearthed the truth about his involvement in the Watergate coverup. 

3) There was intense partisanship over environmental degradation. And yet our government created the EPA, and passed the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act with bipartisan support.

By contrast, in the post-Obama era, the government has been unable to respond effectively to conflicts over race relations, election corruption, or the climate crisis.  Instead, we are a “house divided against itself”. Democrats and Republicans actually dislike members the opposing party. Each group tends to live near, and interact with, like-minded people who get their information from the same sources. It has become easier for members of each party to demonize and stereotype the other and harder for them to share resources or power.

It is more than just intolerance of the other side’s ideas. It is the dissolution of the commitments by which Americans have forged themselves into a single nation. Democratic politics is possible only when citizens agree that their disagreements are bound by a common fate.

The next candidate for president the Democrats **MUST** push is a white, straight, youngish, charismatic and intelligent male. Nothing else will do. This is not the time to play identity politics, this is not the time to try and appeal to the ""woke"" mindset. The Democrats **MUST PLAY OLDSCHOOL BALL**. 

Get a white man to talk about reducing costs, bringing down inflation, **RIP ON REPUBLICANS WITHOUT MERCY**, and who can get down in the mud and fight as dirty as possible against the minions of Trump. 

Trump has shown how to win an election: Get people mad. The Democratic candidate must get people mad, really mad, give speeches with lots of yelling, lots of insults and lots of dirty politics. Blame EVERYTHING, from high costs and unemployment to people so much as stubbing their toe in the morning on a chair on Trump and the Republicans. Basically, Democrats must take over grievance politics the way Trump did but do it better. 

The man must also have a family, 2.3 kids, preferably a blonde pretty wife who looks the part of a perfect housewife. He should come from a middle-class background, working parents, real wholesome, salt of the earth traditional American values kinda thing. Maybe have him talk about when he played sports growing up. Real Leave it to Beaver crap. 

But the candidate must be progressive and seen as a candidate for change. Have them talk about equality and whatnot, but don't go into it to nauseating detail. Just vague ""We're all Americans! We all have a right to live our lives as we see fit! No one has the right to impede on that or shatter your dreams"", kinda stuff. 

What candidates fit this bill? Josh Shapiro, Gavin Newsome, Eric Swalwell, John Kennedy III, John Ossoff, people like them. Younger, more powerful voices that aren't too much off of the norm of what people expect a president to look and sound like and would be complete removal from any weird ass freak the GOP could put up. (Vance)

Anything that deviates from the norm: a woman, a woman of color, a trans person, a gay person, a man of color, they will lose in 2028. The Democrats MUST go back to traditional norms for candidates. Too much progressiveness, too much ""woke"" will sink them. It's time to retreat to what is classically expected of a presidential candidate. 

Don't get me wrong. I happily voted for Kamala and was excited to finally see a woman of color sit in the Oval Office, but the rest of the country isn't. You need a candidate who can win white men and only another white man can do it. 

So, for the country to move forward, the democrats must take a step back and pick more traditional candidates, lest we face more misery under GOP rule.",11,2024-11-08 17:35:46,2024-11-09 07:53:24,-0.8

1. **Ban plurality voting, and replace it with approval** - Its the ""easiest"", cheapest, and simplest reform to do. And should largely be the 'bar minimum' of reforms that  can adopted easily at every local level.

2. **Lower the threshold for preferential voting referendums** - So that Star and Ranked advocates can be happy. I'm fine with other preferential type ballots, I just think its too difficult to adopt. Approval is easier and should be the default, but we should make different methods easier to implement.

3. **Put names in front of candidates names** - This won't get too much pushback, and would formally make people think more along party lines similar to how Europe votes.

4.  **Lower threshold for third parties** - It would give smaller parties a winning chance. With the parties in ballot names, it coalesces the idea of multiple parties.

5. [Unified Primaries & Top-Two Runoff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wl5KkUUjQXg&ab_channel=EqualVoteCoalition) - Which I feel would be easier to implement after more third parties become commonplace.

6. **Adopt Unicameral Legislatures** - It makes bureaucracy easier and less partisan.

7. **Allow the Unicameral Legislature to elect the Attorney General** - Congresses will never vote for Heads of State the way that Europe does. So letting them elect Attorney Generals empowers Unicameral Congresses in a non-disruptive way.

PoliticalDiscussion,controversial,Did the Democratic Party create Trumpism by shutting out its own reformers?,"From 2008 to 2024, the Democratic Party faced multiple challenges from within its own ranks—Barack Obama’s early reform message, Bernie Sanders’s populist campaigns in 2016 and 2020, and RFK Jr.’s attempt to run in 2024. Each gained large grassroots support, but each ultimately faced strong institutional resistance.

In 2016, Sanders won millions of votes and drew record crowds, but leaked emails later revealed DNC officials had coordinated in favor of Hillary Clinton. In 2020, after Sanders won the popular vote in the first three states, establishment figures quickly consolidated behind Joe Biden. And in 2024, RFK Jr. left the party to run as an independent after being sidelined from the primary and later excluded from the general election debate.

Some argue this repeated pattern of shutting out reform candidates helped fuel populist backlash and created the conditions for Trump’s rise.

Given that primary voters tend to be further from the center than the median voter, that would suggest that he would have performed even worse in a general election.

The Democratic party is a big tent.  (Given their demographics, the Republicans don't need to be.)

About half of that Democratic tent is moderate to conservative.  Many among them are non-white, working class and socially moderate to conservative.

Most of the other half is establishment liberal, not populist.

Dems win when they have a leader who can unify the liberal and moderate/conservative blocs.

Given the diversity of those groups, that requires charisma.

Few people are charismatic.  Bill Clinton and Obama were both highly charismatic politicians.  

Biden had a bit of it in 2020, playing the role of kindly, stable uncle (albeit gaffe prone), although he lost it fairly quickly once elected.

Bernie Sanders is a crank and a curmudgeon.  He will be highly appealing to enough people that he can come in second place.  He will never win a presidential election.

Unlike her husband, Hillary Clinton is almost anti-charismatic.  Kamala Harris is not much better.

If the Dems are going to allow their branding decisions to be made by scolds who don't appreciate the needs of a big tent and a charismatic unifying figure, then they will keep losing.  So far, they seem determined to lose.

They also need to keep the left from burning down the tent.  Bill Clinton used the Sister Souljah moment to push back the left activists and brand the party as his rather than theirs.  Dems who fail to prevent the left from hijacking the brand will pay dearly for it.

Today's Democrats lack the fortitude to do what Bill Clinton did, even though the rebranding is more important than ever.",13,2025-06-08 07:46:56,2025-06-08 15:41:59,-0.5

Haley should probably be the exact kind of person the GOP is promoting as a future president to get them back on track, but she's not going to be able to get past the Trump sycophants.

I don't think Harris would be able to win a Democrat primary either. She stands a better chance than Haley would, but I lean towards her losing that as well. There's going to be a big culture of fear in the Democratic Party in regards to 2028 in the same way there was in 2020, and a Biden-type is probably going to be who the party goes for. Or just a straight white guy in general who seems to be a ""safe"" pick. I'm not entirely sure she will run anyways, it'd be an embarrassing end to her career to lose a presidential primary and she may rather go out as California governor and the first black woman to be a governor rather than risking another presidential bid which seems more likely to be unsuccessful than successful.",30,2025-05-10 13:24:40,2025-05-11 00:09:36,0.0

",0,0,0,"Man, my simple answer regarding Russia is this: it's the North, dude!  
Life is tough and short for the homeless here. Try to understand, or  
come visit. Temperatures are usually below freezing, with knee-deep snow  
from November to March. (This year, by the way, there’s almost no snow  
and it’s much warmer — hello to climate skeptics!) So, the thing is,  
life here has always only been possible through close ties and  
dependence on society and the state. 

Do you get what I mean? 

The state  
builds roads, the state maintains them, the state decides whether you’ll  
have gas heating in your house or if you’ll be heating with firewood.  
And even at the level of local officials, the state decides which stores  
you’ll shop at, not to mention schools for kids. And so — you weren’t  
born in the forest but within a cell of society. The state shaped your  
worldview through 100% mandatory schooling and through a bunch of  
government TV channels that are free and turned on by default, covering  
all basic informational and entertainment needs. 

Who’s gonna head out into some frozen forest to start a guerrilla campaign? 

In civilization, you have everything you’re used to for living, even formally free  
healthcare, which admittedly treats worse and worse, but at least any  
treatment is relatively fast and free! 

So all the country's resources flow into Putin’s hands in Moscow; all key enterprises across all sectors of economics are controlled by those close to Putin. 

So what? With what money  
are you going to make a revolution?",2,2025-03-16 18:49:16,2025-03-17 08:27:57,0.4

What does government do well and what does government not do well?",5,2,3,"I'll take a swing at this.

My pops passed away when I was in the 8th grade and Social Security Insurance ensured that me, my sister, and immigrant mother had a shot in this world. It was definitely more than my dad paid in and it saved our family even though he had decent life insurance. The same benefit that Paul Ryan benefitted from and wanted to remove from everyone else, btw, because he was rich enough that it was extra money to them. The government kept its promise to my father by ensuring his family always had some form of resources until we turned 18.

I had a pretty bad stuttering problem when very young and the special classes I got to attend through the public school system. I was then able to communicate with my classmates better which improved my grades which led to actual academic achievement and success. The government fulfilled its obligation to provide a safe learning environment and even let me play sports on its dime, as well. Anecdotal, but it appears that on a mass scale the government is largely delivering on this promise. We're not pumping out geniuses, but that's not the mission. We rate well, on average, with our world peers.

During my time in the Navy I was taught how to operate a nuclear reactor by a group with zero incidents since being bestowed the responsibility of operating and maintaining nuclear power plants above and below the surface of the water. Imagine an organization that has been training 18 year olds from all levels of education to safely qualify to stand watch over literally the power center of one of the largest nuclear arsenals or air wings in the world.

This government has maintained the USA as the cultural power center of the world for many decades. It has lost its luster, especially amongst peers, but few countries represent a positivity that radiates beyond the slimy sheen. This is not just because of the Hollywood and its reach, our products get everywhere because our government opens and maintains these channels.

I will freely state this government sucks in a ton of ways and as a small business owner I assure you the suck is extended to that world, as well. It's just that the alternative is businesses and the rich getting away with whatever they want and I'm not down with that. Government should fill the gaps of services not provided by the commercial markets and society's protections against the whims of the rich.",34,2025-03-07 20:26:34,2025-03-07 23:14:40,0.6

Ultimately, I believe any form of government works… in theory (except those based on subjugation, slavery, racism, sexism, etc.). The problem each form of government has is that *people are involved*. A king can be an amazing ruler that is adored by the people, but he can also be cruel. It’s all about the person.

Ultimately, eventually, someone bad will come along. The benefit of a unitary executive is they can fix things fast… but they can also corrupt things fast. If you decentralize, then things change slower; it’s slower to fix things, but it’s also slower to corrupt.

I think America is seeing the whiplash of going from decades of gridlock as a decentralized government to the speed of a unitary executive. That particular individual, in my opinion, is not a good person, so it has some devastating ramifications.

Governments aren’t good or bad at anything. They’re exactly as effective as the people who run them.",4,2025-03-07 20:26:34,2025-03-07 23:18:36,0.1

According to people who were around Trump at the time, he was fascinated by how much money FOX News was raking in, and how much sociopolitical power the network had, mostly based on right-wing culture war punditry. At that time, Trump had run for President once before (as an independent), with no real success in getting any traction. But he had managed to accrue some political clout and a great deal of public attention for his ""Birtherism"" lie about Obama not being born in the US ( a stupid lie, because even if he'd been born in Kenya, nobody was disputing that Obama's mother was an American citizen, thus making him born an American). 

The book alleges that Trump's plan was to run for President, use the platform to garner as much attention as possible, and then try to leverage all of that into a 24 cable network, *Trump TV*. He didn't actually expect to win the Republican nomination, let alone win the general election. Since then, multiple sources who were there, have acknowledged that he was dumbfounded and ecstatic when the returns starting coming in. When it was clear he would win (in 2016), Melania is said to have run out of the room in tears. 

Given Trump's decades long history of trying to step into markets he didn't have the experience to be successful in (Trump Airline, Trump Casino's, Trump Steaks, etc.), this story sounds very plausible to me.",4,2025-02-01 20:38:00,2025-02-02 20:36:02,0.6

PoliticalDiscussion,controversial,What are your thoughts on unified power?,"
It's an old idea tied to some of the Marxist schools of thought, although in fact some of the theory predates his birth by a century to Rousseau. It dissents from the way Americans would think of separation of powers, as well as the way constitutional monarchies would have viewed such a concept as well (back when kings had stronger autonomous power, in some cases the prime minister didn't even need express confidence of parliament). It isn't technically an economic system, it could be used without a socialistic system or anything built on a socialist platform, but the Marxist forms of communism was one of the main advocates. 

To me, given what we know about how stable and peaceful societies can work, it's actually rather a dull idea to me. It concentrates a lot of power in something called a supreme state organ of power, which I will just call the assembly or parliament to keep it relatable. It can establish, disestablish, and reformat other departments as it wishes, and is the principal source of legitimacy through which popular decisions (people, not degree of public approval) are made. 

We know that strong democracies which are places that most people would be quite happy to live in such as Finland or New Zealand do not have the power of courts to strike laws down by conflict with the constitution. We know that in places like Finland or Austria, Parliament itself can amend the constitution itself (in the case of Austria, it's basically a 2/3 vote, although sometimes the mostly ceremonial upper house has to approve of changes too). Some high courts of some countries like the Netherlands have the legislature be the source of who appoints their members (the House of Representatives in the Dutch case, although they de facto take a list of candidates from a technical judicial council to choose from), or how in Switzerland, the supreme court judges (without the power to void federal laws) are elected for 6 year renewable terms by a joint session of parliament by secret ballot, and Swiss people evidently rejected a proposal in a referendum to choose the judges in a different way not too long ago. Plus, some countries particularly stringently control the use of executive directives and ministerial orders like Sweden via the approval of the assembly. 

And in a parliamentary system, by definition the executive has the confidence of the legislature but some go even further and solely empower the legislature to choose the prime minister without any head of state involvement and the selection and dismissal of ministers is done solely by the legislature (as in Bavaria). Places like Britain and Canada make the independent officers like the auditor general and the director of public prosecutions dependent on Parliament, for the existence of their office which was created by statute and to be appointed or dismissed from office ahead of their term of office expiring. Unified power does allow the legislature to prescribe how exactly something will be done and is perfectly fine with dividing a function up to prevent things like corruption, such as demanding one person have the key to something, one person authorizes the use of the key, another person possesses the lock, and another person records the use of the key. 

Recalling parliament is a relatively rare power which the doctrine of unified power advocates for but about half the German states do permit this, as does Lithuania, where a petition signed by enough people triggers a question to the people of whether to hold a new election, and if it passes, then a new election is so held.

When put like that, it's actually kinda boring to read much of the literature on Unified Power vs Separation of Powers. The reasons underpinning why most people would not call a place like China or the USSR a democracy has little to do with the theoretical power of the legislature to do just about anything, and at least in the places where they are strongly democratic like New Zealand for instance, at least on the plus side how they in practice act like they are going by unified power then when a reform is passed by parliament with the public having persuaded people to agree with it, it will not be blocked by an outside power the way many Americans hate the times when the supreme court blocked political financing legislation.

What do you think?",0,0,0,"In Finland courts can refuse to apply laws based on conflict with Constitution.

In New Zealand courts can issue declarations of inconsistency with their Bill of Rights and fundamentally reinterpret the statutes to be consistent.   Parliament is obligated to respond to and deal with the declaration of inconsistency.

In both cases, there is a  parliamentary review AT THE TIME THE LAW IS PASSED to ensure the law is consistent with their constitution/bill of rights.

Both of these systems have sovereign parliaments - they are not presidential systems and we are not talking about their equivalent of ""executive orders"" because they dont have them.  Prime ministers are not presidents.   There is a very clear separation of powers.  These are not ""unified power"" systems and certainly not what the US is now toying with, a ""unitary executive"" power.

In fact the very concept of separation of powers was first coined and expressed in the context of parliamentary democracy (Locke/Montesquieu, both describing British parliamentary democracy).

And in a parliamentary system, by definition the executive has the confidence of the legislature but some go even further and solely empower the legislature to choose the prime minister without any head of state involvement and the selection and dismissal of ministers is done solely by the legislature (as in Bavaria). Places like Britain and Canada make the independent officers like the auditor general and the director of public prosecutions dependent on Parliament, for the existence of their office which was created by statute and to be appointed or dismissed from office ahead of their term of office expiring. Unified power does allow the legislature to prescribe how exactly something will be done and is perfectly fine with dividing a function up to prevent things like corruption, such as demanding one person have the key to something, one person authorizes the use of the key, another person possesses the lock, and another person records the use of the key. 

Recalling parliament is a relatively rare power which the doctrine of unified power advocates for but about half the German states do permit this, as does Lithuania, where a petition signed by enough people triggers a question to the people of whether to hold a new election, and if it passes, then a new election is so held.

When put like that, it's actually kinda boring to read much of the literature on Unified Power vs Separation of Powers. The reasons underpinning why most people would not call a place like China or the USSR a democracy has little to do with the theoretical power of the legislature to do just about anything, and at least in the places where they are strongly democratic like New Zealand for instance, at least on the plus side how they in practice act like they are going by unified power then when a reform is passed by parliament with the public having persuaded people to agree with it, it will not be blocked by an outside power the way many Americans hate the times when the supreme court blocked political financing legislation. 

  
What do you think?",0,0,0,"I don't think it's necessarily a matter of getting behind any kind of political or economic ""system.""  I notice that, in political discussions, a lot of people compare various ""systems,"" much like people might be trying to build a better mousetrap.  

The ""system"" somehow becomes the central focus in people's minds, as if to imply that all we have to do is come up with some kind of perfect or foolproof structure, everything will work out well.  

But in practice, we're talking about systems comprised of human beings where there can be an infinite number of random elements in play.  

I've heard it said that all forms of politics are dirty; democracy and dictatorship are simply variations on the same theme:  Please the mob.  

Another quote which might sum it up is this:  **""Human beings, my friend, are a very complex paradox. Very, very dangerous. They don't wanna' be leaders, they wanna' be followers.

What do you think?",0,0,0,"And to add, the US *does* have an independent “parliament”- we just call it Congress. The big distinction is that the President is not a *creature of parliament*.

In the UK, for example, the PM is subject to the whims of the majority coalition (much like our Speaker of the House is). The PM, though it’s the closest analog to the President, has very little if any authority to *oppose* parliament at-large. In contrast, the Framers extricated the executive function of government from the legislative to create a check on legislative power. It’s quaint for us today seeing as Congress is MIA, but the Framers were fearful of a vacuous Congress that subsumed all powers into itself.

Call me Constitution-pilled, but there really is a secret sauce with the way the US system was set up. Splitting power between the States and Federal government, and further dividing the State and Federal powers into three equal parts, gives us an absurdly robust defense against government overreach as citizens. It’s a system that typically moves slowly, and only by broad consensus when it does.

Trump, obviously, is the elephant in the room. His administration is throwing its full weight into the guardrails of government in an attempt to accumulate more power. But I think Trump is a perfect example of just how goddamned robust the Constitution and dual-federalism are. Try as he may with a supine Congress and a friendly SCOTUS, he’s *still* encountering resistance at nearly every step. 

I also think that his governing coalition is in for a **very** rude awakening once Democrat-run states rediscover what their Republican-run counterparts have known since Jim Crow: You can basically tell the feds to go fuck themselves on most issues. Between interstate compacts and State sovereignty, blue states can largely take their ball and go home. Even more, *they can start playing their own game and not invite the feds or fed-aligned states to join in.* The Fugitive Slave Act and the non-compliance of Northern states is a shining example.

If places like Idaho want a robust economy, they will diversify their infrastructure to support more tech jobs and the culture of Idaho could change based on the economic opportunities and the systems put in place to support those jobs (i.e. Bozeman).

One way we see the connection between economy and culture is in corruption. In places that see corruption as acceptable, we see worse economic outcomes over time. A voter may disregard corruption because it is not against their understanding of the cultural norms. But in time the economy suffers. Other cultural indicators impact economic opportunity too.

Could you provide examples of this?  I feel like most of the times people are opposed to culture-based voting, it's usually just a difference in beliefs about the world and values.  Like not believing multi-culturalism comes with any problems, feeling like the current culture isn't worth protecting, or believing the economical benefits outweigh the cultural drawbacks.

The ""irrational"" critique is often levied at arguments posed by those motivated by culture, such as those that claim immigrants commit more crime, or those that complain about immigrants stealing jobs from Americans, but that's not a critique of voting based on culture, it's a critique of voting based on a misunderstanding of reality.",4,2025-10-21 00:34:24,2025-10-21 00:43:59,0

But the Republican party itself did not do so well all things considered. They have one of the narrowest margins in the House ever. The only Senate seat in a true swing state that they won was PA. They lost NV, AZ, MI, and WI.

That doesn’t read to me like a decisive conservative/Republican shift. It reads to me like a repudiation of Joe Biden and his direct affiliates (i.e. Kamala Harris).

Maybe it’s all cope. And so be it. But I genuinely think Trump and the Republicans are misreading their mandate by going as far as they are.

Trump is only the second president (other than Grover Cleveland) who lost reelection to run again and win. He faced an opponent who was only given about 3.5 months to mount a campaign against him. His opponent was the VP of one of the most unpopular presidents of the last 50 years and was directly implicated on the question of Biden’s mental fitness for office. She did little to separate herself from an unpopular president. Despite this, Harris still won over 48% of the vote. 

Trump also has an ability to draw in support from low propensity voters and some democrats. We have no idea whether the next Republican president will be able to replicate his coalition or build a winning one of their own. 

So sure, it’s very possible that Trump’s win was a genuine shift towards conservatism. It’s also possible that the circumstances of this election were unique and Trump was the beneficiary of facing a weak opponent.",49,2025-02-12 20:38:51,2025-02-13 04:35:29,0

What do you think?",12,6,6,"We live in strange times. Here's how I figure it. 

The modern Republican Party, and American conservatism is general, is largely a backlash against the progress made by blacks and women in the 1960s and 70s. It was shortly after this that they turned against the government they felt had betrayed them. ""Government is the problem"" said president Reagan. They became against nearly every policy that might materially benefit average Americans because now that included *them*. And white America decided that rather than swim with our black neighbors we would rather drain the public pool and fill it in permanently. If we have to share it with them, then *nobody* will have it. And this is why we don't have nice things like healthcare, decent wages, child care, senior care and all the rest of it.

It was around this same time that evangelicals began to develop strong feelings about abortion that they'd never had before. It was around this same time that a 200 year old marksmanship and gun safety outfit became a radical gun rights lobbying group.

Meanwhile, the rest of us get a little more progressive with each passing decade. Next thing you know, there's a black family in the White House for eight years, Democrats were certain to put a woman in next, plus gay people can get married now! It was too much for some. 

Along comes Donald Trump. Aside from the fact that he's a clown-faced ignoramus, what really set him apart from others on the political scene was his open racism and misogyny. Finally! Someone will defend our vanishing way of life! (Of white supremacy and patriarchy, etc.) 

Problem is, his brand of politics isn't quite popular enough to win reliably, not without a strong tailwind. He got it in 2016 thanks to Comey and Putin and he won. He didn't get it in 2020 and he lost. But he lucked into a boost again in 2024 thanks to post-pandemic inflation, causing voters to (wrongly) blame the incumbent party for and give him the edge. 

So here we are. Is it a durable ideological shift toward conservatism? No, I don't think so.",36,2025-02-12 20:38:51,2025-02-13 05:26:31,0.9

",6,3,3,"The progressive era of the early 1900’s with Teddy up through the FDR super coalition was built on workers rights and quality of life.

It’s not rocket science - it just needs to do that again. Focus on all workers in all industries. Not urban only, not divisive identity grievances.

There were basically 4 major aspects of the progressive super coalition from my view:

* Trust-busting. Big monopolies across the board were smashed into competing smaller companies. When there’s a single employer in a field, wages plummet. When there’s competition, pay + quality of life perks increase as companies compete for talent.
* Workers rights. The workweek, eliminating dangerous conditions, minimum wage to prevent labor exploitation when a competitive market fails to make that happen naturally.
* Immigration restriction. Progressives put caps on immigrants by nation… because in the Industrial Revolution waves of immigrants would cross the Union picket lines and do the job for less.
* Big new infrastructure projects. We built damns, the interstate highway, then sent a man to the moon through government funded initiatives. Net new, awe inspiring projects.

The delta between that and where the left is now is hopefully obvious.

The left has unfocused tax the rich energy, but no spine at busting up large companies that raise prices and lower wages. You don’t fix that with a wealth tax or some regulation, you smash the abusive company into pieces. Obama failed badly here by declaring banks “too big to fail”. Wrong. They are too big to exist. Only Liz Warren has this diagnosis correctly, but she just reacts and grandstands to whatever company is the news that week with zero consistency in prioritization or follow up.

The left claims to be for worker rights, but mostly they lazily throw crumbs at the bottom 10% in some minimum wage bumps and hand outs. Practically nothing for the middle 80%, other than fixing a couple health care corner cases. Your working class wants a dignified and fulfilled life with social mobility, not zero accountability and handouts for criminals and addicts.

The left is in total denial that immigrants suppress wages by surplus labor lowering negotiating power. Giving our coveted university spots to foreign nationals from nations that are hostile or ambivalent to us is a colossal strategic error and disservice our own citizens. They need to change their thinking here, immediately. 

The left likes infrastructure, but all they are able to do is put together a giant slush fund then allocate it to projects that are already the responsibility of states & private companies. Biden’s bill was almost a trillion but I can’t differentiate in the slightest what new thing happened because of it. Most of it when to maintenance of existing bridges and roads, and the rest to tax breaks and research grants of private companies. Stop doing that. 

Set targets on something big, new, and ambitious. The energy grid 2.0, 100% green. A project on the scale of the interstate or space program that only the federal government could do. Break it down into milestones, progress and execute on it. Or do connected high speed rail. Same thing.

Going to Cape Canaveral and watching recordings of JFK challenge then nation gives me the feels and I was born 15 years after the moon landing. Can’t fathom what that was like at the time. You know what *doesn’t* give those feels? Having to google the local highway re-paving to see 10% funding add from the fed.",43,2024-11-20 12:18:34,2024-11-20 20:04:03,-0.40

",6,3,3,"Simplify and amplify your message into 2 tenets: Personal freedom and an anti-corporation/billionaire rhetoric. We have your back to protect your rights, and we will be your advocate to fight against the bloodsucking billionaires destroying this country so you can have well paying jobs and provide for your family. Yes, I know that's basically Bernie Sanders in a nutshell, but I think if you can package that in a younger candidate you can start to project an effective populist message. And you have to really hone in your messaging to just those 2 things. Dems have a big tent, but at some point you gotta distill your message to core themes. There's a reason people said they don't know what Kamala stood for: there was just so much her campaign tried to impart in 100 days, messaging just felt distilled unless you paid attention every day or week. That's not how the electorate works.

1. Frame the republicans (correctly) as trying to take away basic established freedoms. No backsliding, we will fight against their incursion. We will fight for your rights. Really get the dem base going with this one, I would even argue dems should analyze and pull back gun rhetoric since it's just a losing issue in america, as much as it pains me to say that. I think as well if this future trump admin tries to do anything with gay marriage, REALLY hammer that home. Americans are in favor of gay marriage as a concept, so any attacks against it need to be met with righteous indignation, and framing it as a ""they are coming for this, what's next that they will take away?"" to alleviate some culture-war connotations.
2. And then economically, you can do a ton of good by (accurately) framing the issues regular americans are having as a problem with mega corporations and billionaires. I mean REALLY hammer the issue, starting right now. At every turn, when the topic of prices and jobs and housing comes up, immediately bring up how it's corporations and billionaires' fault we are in this mess. I really do think that would resonate with a huge swath of this country. People can see and understand that instead of a lecture on economics. Why are things bad right now? Corporations. Dems are doing that a bit today, but they need to escalate that rhetoric significantly

Moreover for that economic point, we need a common enemy to rally around and address, if you can pull people away from this ridiculous notion that immigrants are responsible for economic issues and housing issues, and instead redirect people's justifiable outrage at high prices and lack of housing, we can do a lot of good. Distill it down the the most basic ""corporations are anti-american. The people and you in particular are real america and you are the rightful heir to the future"". 

Take these tenets on the road and meet the electorate where they are. Podcasts, tiktok, whatever. Flood the space with your message for the next 4 years. And take this message to every downballot race and midterm from here until 2028 to create momentum of that messaging. Dems have to be lock step together in messaging. And pray to god 2028's primary elevates the right candidate who can embody that message.

All that said, though, I'm not holding breath because that would require a huge groundswell of support for fundraising and the like and accept that corporate support of dems will decline. The cards are stacked against us since we effectively are living in an oligarchy, corporations control politics.",3,2024-11-20 12:18:34,2024-11-21 17:20:25,0.95

“Work for us, and in return, you’ll get paid just enough to spend on living in our properties, on buying our goods to survive, and at the end of the day, your only form of leisure will be spending 4-5 hours watching TV, for which we also collect the subscription fees.”

Is there a way for left-wing politics to find a voice that appeals to both the middle class and the poorest segments of society? Can it target them with messages that make them feel that this alternative is the one that can secure the best possible life not only for themselves but also for future generations?
",6,3,3,"Based on my personal feelings from this election and the one in 2016 which I'm having quite a bit of flashbacks of, here are my top three things that Democrats should do going forward:

#1. Stop playing defense
#2. Work the refs
#3. Let the leopords eat some faces

1: Stop feeling like you need to respond to everything and be opposed to every single thing that comes out. Deflect and go on offense. Nothing has gone in our favor when we're spinning in circles pointing out things that folks already know. We know what the GOP says is crazy. When you have airtime make bold assertions about where you think the country should go and the problems that need to be addressed. Key example: I don't care that Kamala has a gun. I care that she didn't ask how many kids the GOP has killed through their 'guns for criminals' policies. 

2: This is the practical application of #1 in a lot of cases but stop treating the press as impartial. The way content is consumed dictates that they generate competition and rage. Rage is not impartial. When asked for detailed policy to address problems, start and end by asking why the interviewer hasn't asked that of the GOP and then make bold assertions about where the country should go and the problems that need to be addressed. Key example: When asked about a tweet or a new crazy idea floated by the GOP, point out that it's crazy or stupid using those words and then ask why they haven't lowered the inflation rate yet. 

3: This is probably the most contriversal one, but for most things, make your objection to it and then use your time to go on offense. Reacting to everything isn't working, clearly. Democrats should go on offense talking about what they will fix and present a high level vision of a Democrat government. WIthout any real power, there is only so much political capital to expend so use it wisely. The GOP has made a business in being aggrevied and prevented from doing the things they say they're going to do. Trying to do somethign but being mired in legal challenges and folks laying down in the road is their preferred position. ""I tried to fix this problem, but the Democrats stopped us"" is what they want. Key example: Immigration. They run another four years on deportation if the country doesn't see the effects of losing out on immigrant labor. 

Now, I'm aware that this opinion, especially #3 comes from a place of privledge and that fighting the good fight is it's own reward. This is about changing a paradigm that is NOT working and having a longer term view of where we spend our energy to make real, lasting progress.

Some bonus ones without any context 

-Prioritize new media over old media

-Be abrasive and combative, refer to #2

-Have a tight set of things that the GOP is doing to ruin America, refer to #2

-Stop talking about how we're going to pay for things, Refer to #2

-Co-opt the swamp messaging. Hiring unqualified cronies to do your bidding is the definition of the swamp",9,2024-11-20 12:18:34,2024-11-20 19:55:19,0.7
PoliticalDiscussion,controversial,How Can the Left Redefine Itself?,"Looking across the Western world, right-wing populist movements are gaining more and more popularity. It is difficult to dispute that this rise is largely rooted in the continued growth of social inequality.

As in the past, these radical movements today channel the desperation of the poorer segments of society and the declining middle class into campaigns fueled by hate, such as:

	•	“Immigration is taking your jobs and your country.”

	•	“Internal enemies are selling out our nation and destroying your way of life.”

	•	“Minorities (whether defined by ethnicity, religion, or race) are poisoning our nation.”

One could continue listing similar arguments through which today’s “conservative” movements—though I prefer to call this the rise of far-right ideologies—win elections or at least attract massive voter bases.

",6,3,3,"This might be a strange view, but they should probably focus on state level races more than federal. 

Even if you support something like universal healthcare, let’s be honest- the federal government doing something that big and complex isn’t going to happen. Why not focus on states, and have state-level universal healthcare? This is why we have a federal system. If it succeeds, then people will move there and enjoy it, and other states can adopt their policies. If it fails, then it doesn’t bring down the whole country with it. 

The federal government was never designed to be as big as it is now. States can handle your issues much better than the federal government if they put in the effort.",2,2024-11-20 12:18:34,2024-11-20 20:23:19,0.5

> *Can it target them with messages that make them feel that this alternative is the one that can secure the best possible life not only for themselves but also for future generations?*

The source of how right wing media has come to power is one you should study. The demise of the fairness doctrine in the 80s led to the rise of Fox and right wing blowhards, probably the most famous of which was Rush Limbaugh. 

One of the things that helped them was to have a daily memo about ""The Subject"" and how every barking head on Fox had to focus their content on that day's ""2 Minute Hate"". This led to a monolithic approach to the propaganda that right wing viewers consumed.",2,2024-11-20 12:18:34,2024-11-21 18:45:21,0.9

Abby Phillips at CNN and many others criticized Barack Obama and Mamdani for not praising Donald Trump for his negotiations — that only he could do despite the plan having been in place for over a year now negotiated by the Biden administration. Incredible how easily fooled, or lack of character, so many people can be boxed into.

EDIT: I'm reading the indictment, and let me quote it here:

>On or about September 26, 2025, at approximately 7:45 a.m., Agent A was wearing civilian clothes driving a government-owned vehicle (the “Government Vehicle”) to the BSSA to report for his official duties. Agent A’s official duties at the BSSA included supervising logistics such as intake, processing, bedspace and transportation coordination for those temporarily detained in Broadview, communicating with upper management and federal partners to manage operations and ensure necessary supplies and proper staffing levels, and responding to requests for information, both internally and from the public

>On or about September 26, 2025, at Broadview, in the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, MICHAEL RABBITT, KATHERINE MARIE ABUGHAZALEH, ANDRE MARTIN, CATHERINE SHARP, BRIAN STRAW, and JOSELYN WALSH, defendants herein, conspired with one another and others, known and unknown, to prevent by force, intimidation, and threat, Agent A, a United States law enforcement officer, from discharging the duties of his office, and to injure him in his person or property on account of his lawful discharge of the duties of his office, and while engaged in the lawful discharge thereof, and to injure his property so as to interrupt, hinder, and impede him in the discharge of his official duties.

If he was driving to report to his duties....THEN HE WASN'T ON DUTY.  Therefore they could not have interfered with his duties because he wasn't doing them yet.

>The indictment alleges that the group ""conspired with one another and others, known and unknown, to prevent by force, intimidation, and threat, Agent A, a United States law enforcement officer, from discharging the duties of his office, and to injure him in his person or property on account of his lawful discharge of the duties of his office, and while engaged in the lawful discharge thereof, and to injure his property so as to interrupt, hinder, and impede him in the discharge of his official duties.""

Politics,hot,Trump Ordered Secret East Wing Teardown in F-Word Rant: Author,,11313,10973,340,"This is going well.

From the article:

"" President Donald Trump schemed to keep his violent destruction of the White House’s East Wing hidden from the American public, according to author Michael Wolff.

The president abandoned his earlier promise to leave the East Wing untouched after learning from engineers that the quickest way to complete his $300 million ballroom would be to raze the historic building, Wolff shared on the Inside Trump’s Head podcast.

“They had a meeting and they said, ‘Listen, it really would be much cheaper and faster just to tear down the East Wing,’” Wolff said, citing a source familiar with the matter.

Rather than weigh the consequences of erasing the 123-year-old building’s history, the president’s first concern was reportedly how to keep its potential destruction hidden from the public.

“[Trump] said—this was given to me as a quote—he said, ‘F---. But can we do the demolition at night?,’“ Wolff told co-host Joanna Coles.

“So the idea would be, Washington would wake up and the East Wing would have evaporated,” Coles said. """,4308,2025-10-29 03:12:16,2025-10-29 03:16:11,0.5
