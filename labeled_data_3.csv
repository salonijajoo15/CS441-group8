I will never forgive the likes of CNN for how it treated Joe Biden who has been a phenomenal president. His selfless act of putting country over self is simply the cherry on top.

Biden was able to make deals with the most obstructionist opposition in modern US history ( if not ever, apart from the era around the civil war ),

And he didn`t just make any normal deals, he created the biggest and most extensive legislation packages in all of American history.

democrats,controversial,Reflections on a Divisive Election: Finding Hope in a Time of Uncertainty,"I’m deeply disappointed and troubled by the direction our country has taken with the re-election of Donald Trump, along with the strengthening of Republican majorities in Congress. This decision feels like a setback for so many of the values we cherish and protect. Trump’s previous administration was rife with mistakes and troubling actions—disregard for science, mishandling of the pandemic, divisive rhetoric, repeated challenges to the rule of law, and policies that harmed marginalized communities. These actions, to me, have been at odds with the leadership our country truly needs.

Giving Republicans control of both houses in Congress also threatens some of the most important aspects of our democracy and well-being. It’s likely we will see shifts in the Supreme Court with lasting effects on reproductive rights, which are fundamental to our autonomy. Support for Ukraine and America’s role in international stability may be questioned, leaving allies vulnerable. And policies that provide a lifeline to the most vulnerable in our society—families struggling to make ends meet, communities fighting for access to healthcare, and children in need of safety and support—could face drastic cuts and neglect.

In the face of this moment, I can’t help but feel a deep need for reflection as a country. How did we arrive here, making decisions that seem to run so counter to the values of equity, compassion, and progress? There’s a real need to look inward, to have those difficult conversations, and to work toward an understanding of how we can move forward better and stronger.

And yet, my heart is heavy thinking about waking my daughter—again—for the second time in her young life to tell her that the glass ceiling of a woman president remains unbroken. For all the hope and progress that has marked her short life, this reminder of how far we still have to go feels especially painful.

I am also deeply concerned about the continued presence of election interference, both foreign and domestic. Misinformation, threats of retribution, and even false bomb threats targeting polling centers to discourage likely Democratic voters have cast a shadow over our democratic process. This isn’t simply about who wins or loses; it’s about the integrity of our elections and the faith we place in them to truly represent the voice of the people.

To those feeling hurt, confused, and scared—I am right there with you. This isn’t just a matter of disappointment; it’s a profound worry about the future of our country and the values we hold dear. I feel the weight of this decision on a personal level, as many of you likely do. It’s a time of uncertainty, and I know I’m not alone in feeling anxious about what lies ahead. I want you to know that every one of your concerns, fears, and frustrations is valid. We are in this together, sharing the same questions and the same hopes, even as we struggle to make sense of this moment.

As we look to the future, it’s more unpredictable than it’s been in a long time, and that unpredictability is unsettling. We are likely facing challenges that will push us all in ways we haven't imagined, yet despite everything, we must hold tight to the idea that this is not the end of our story. Democracy, though it may feel fragile right now, finds strength in the bonds that connect us—in the courage of communities that stand up for what’s right and in the compassion of people who look out for each other when times are tough. We are not powerless, and we are not without hope.

And there are reasons for hope. In this election, some incredible firsts remind us of the progress we are capable of. In Delaware, Sarah McBride has made history as the first openly trans member of Congress, a powerful step toward inclusion. Many states, including Arizona, Colorado, Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and New York, have taken action to protect reproductive freedom in their constitutions, and Illinois has expanded access to IVF by requiring insurance coverage. Several states across the country have guaranteed sick leave and increased access to marijuana, while California, Colorado, and Hawaii have removed bans on same-sex marriage from their constitutions. These victories show that, even when national outcomes disappoint, there are still powerful moments of progress worth celebrating.

This might be a dark chapter, but our shared commitment to justice, equality, and progress is a powerful light. Together, with resilience and unity, we can still shape a future that reflects the best of who we are. While the immediate path may be hard to see, we can carry each other forward. Let’s not forget that we have the power to create change—and no election outcome can ever take that from us.

With hope, resilience, and a belief in the promise of our future,

I am also deeply concerned about the continued presence of election interference, both foreign and domestic. Misinformation, threats of retribution, and even false bomb threats targeting polling centers to discourage likely Democratic voters have cast a shadow over our democratic process. This isn’t simply about who wins or loses; it’s about the integrity of our elections and the faith we place in them to truly represent the voice of the people.

To those feeling hurt, confused, and scared—I am right there with you. This isn’t just a matter of disappointment; it’s a profound worry about the future of our country and the values we hold dear. I feel the weight of this decision on a personal level, as many of you likely do. It’s a time of uncertainty, and I know I’m not alone in feeling anxious about what lies ahead. I want you to know that every one of your concerns, fears, and frustrations is valid. We are in this together, sharing the same questions and the same hopes, even as we struggle to make sense of this moment.

As we look to the future, it’s more unpredictable than it’s been in a long time, and that unpredictability is unsettling. We are likely facing challenges that will push us all in ways we haven't imagined, yet despite everything, we must hold tight to the idea that this is not the end of our story. Democracy, though it may feel fragile right now, finds strength in the bonds that connect us—in the courage of communities that stand up for what’s right and in the compassion of people who look out for each other when times are tough. We are not powerless, and we are not without hope.

And there are reasons for hope. In this election, some incredible firsts remind us of the progress we are capable of. In Delaware, Sarah McBride has made history as the first openly trans member of Congress, a powerful step toward inclusion. Many states, including Arizona, Colorado, Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and New York, have taken action to protect reproductive freedom in their constitutions, and Illinois has expanded access to IVF by requiring insurance coverage. Several states across the country have guaranteed sick leave and increased access to marijuana, while California, Colorado, and Hawaii have removed bans on same-sex marriage from their constitutions. These victories show that, even when national outcomes disappoint, there are still powerful moments of progress worth celebrating.

This might be a dark chapter, but our shared commitment to justice, equality, and progress is a powerful light. Together, with resilience and unity, we can still shape a future that reflects the best of who we are. While the immediate path may be hard to see, we can carry each other forward. Let’s not forget that we have the power to create change—and no election outcome can ever take that from us.

With hope, resilience, and a belief in the promise of our future,
-Jake",15,8,7,"I've lost all hope. I'm a 33 year old white male, so it doesn't look like I'd be affected by Trump. But, last night, I watched my and my wife's chances of starting a family end. It's all my wife dreams of, and I can't give that to her because I can't put her at risk. I wanted so badly to be a father. All because there are 70 million imbeciles in this country who thought that re-elececting a 78 year old radical lunatic with dementia was a better option than electing a woman of color. 

I'm angry, I'm embarrassed. I have no clue what to do. And the 20 million who decided that the most important election in history wasn't enough to go out to vote, I have no empathy towards you anymore. This man put me in therapy because he completely broke my mental health, and now, we're going right back. The rest of the world has every right to hate us. We just humiliated ourselves on the global stage. I'm broken. We are truly surrounded by morons.",6,2024-11-06 09:31:46,2024-11-06 14:59:50,0.95
democrats,controversial,Reflections on a Divisive Election: Finding Hope in a Time of Uncertainty,"I’m deeply disappointed and troubled by the direction our country has taken with the re-election of Donald Trump, along with the strengthening of Republican majorities in Congress. This decision feels like a setback for so many of the values we cherish and protect. Trump’s previous administration was rife with mistakes and troubling actions—disregard for science, mishandling of the pandemic, divisive rhetoric, repeated challenges to the rule of law, and policies that harmed marginalized communities. These actions, to me, have been at odds with the leadership our country truly needs.

Giving Republicans control of both houses in Congress also threatens some of the most important aspects of our democracy and well-being. It’s likely we will see shifts in the Supreme Court with lasting effects on reproductive rights, which are fundamental to our autonomy. Support for Ukraine and America’s role in international stability may be questioned, leaving allies vulnerable. And policies that provide a lifeline to the most vulnerable in our society—families struggling to make ends meet, communities fighting for access to healthcare, and children in need of safety and support—could face drastic cuts and neglect.

In the face of this moment, I can’t help but feel a deep need for reflection as a country. How did we arrive here, making decisions that seem to run so counter to the values of equity, compassion, and progress? There’s a real need to look inward, to have those difficult conversations, and to work toward an understanding of how we can move forward better and stronger.

So when the democratic institutions are not working to meet the demands of the overall population, there’s a lot of discontent. And then I think people find themselves in the throes of desperation, or find themselves so angry that they can’t deal with it, that they end up engaging in adventurism, decentralized violence such as this.” - Hasan Piker, a Twitch streamer I have to admit I don't recognize.  Quoted in the Politico editorial *Can America unwind its Gordian knot of political violence?*

To me, this is the best summary of what the situation is like right now.  It used to be that you could trust the branches of government to hold each other accountable, and electoral pressure would keep worst instincts of our representatives at bay.  But now the Supreme Court is bending itself into pretzels to help out the Trump agenda and gerrymandering + dark money have taken the power out of the voters.

So it feels like we have nowhere else to go, totally powerless.  The legitimate means to hold government corruption accountable aren't there.  No courts, no elections.  That radicalizes people and makes them desperate.",9,2025-09-11 13:59:57,2025-09-11 15:16:58,0.7

They dropped the ball in 2016 and havent really come around and fixed their policy and PR issues since then, not nearly enough. 

Running biden - who should have been 1 term only anyway - and then scrambling to put up someone not well known or particularly well liked didnt help. She might have had a chance if Joe had backed off and let her run in the primaries, but probably someone else would have beaten her. Im not really sure thats all about her being a minority/woman but i do not doubt it played a part. She also didnt give straight answers to a lot of questions and that bothered me, even knowing I Was going to vote for her to start with. 

  
That said, i voted for her, and dems down the line - but i have been griping about them for ages now. Their policies, PR, lack of cohesion, and lack of long term planning just keep them at a middle 40/45%  place. 

They also didnt get the house, and lost the 50/50 'edge' in the senate where their VP could at least handle tiebreakers. Its not just about kamala, running against a regularly-dysfunctional republican party and STILL LOSING a majority in both houses should tell them something, but i doubt they will figure it out :-/",4,2024-11-06 14:35:27,2024-11-06 16:30:30,0.5

democrats,controversial,We will fight. We will never surrender.,"Not sure how much of a history geek you are, but I (late gen x) grew up learning about WW2 extensively. Primarily because of my grandfather - who served in the Navy, dodging kamikazes in the Pacific, surviving the Battle of Midway, and served his country admirably. I cannot imagine the horrors that man lived 24/7 during that war. He was 16 when the greatest conflict in human history broke out. Did he dodge the draft with a doctor’s note, citing ‘bone spurs’, like Captain Slapnuts?? No, he fought against an imperialist aggressor waging war. He wasn’t sympathetic to them, he didn’t side with them, and he sure as shit didn’t willingly vote them into office. But I digress.  

The result of this election is absolute horseshit. Seemingly fair and square, thus far. But still horse shit. Moving forward, as Democrats, we need resolve. We mustn’t give up our fight. Truth and righteousness **is on our side**.

Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister during the Second World War, gave a speech on June 4th, 1940. History will remember him as a racist, subscripting to superiority of the British empire, but as a young American learning about world history and that terrible war, I viewed him as a leader that Britain needed at the time. I see parallels in what Britain faced at the time and our situation now - but for us the Nazis have **actually landed on the goddamned beaches**. To quote Jeffrey Lebowski, *the other Jeffrey Lebowski*, “the plane has crashed into the mountain!!”

As we move forward as a party, we need the resolve the Brits had before and during that war. When faced with overwhelming hardships, they fought. When facing a determined enemy bend on their destruction, they were steadfast. When German bombers attempted to completely crush their will, they endured. 

Sorry for the long post, but I have a lot on my mind. Im sure most of you do also. I would like to present you with a small portion of that famous speech, lifted from the end of it, if you wish to seek it out and listen for yourself. Fight. Endure. Persist. 

> I have, myself, full confidence that if all do their duty, if nothing is neglected, and if the best arrangements are made, as they are being made, we shall prove ourselves once again able to defend our Island home, to ride out the storm of war, and **to outlive the menace of tyranny, if necessary for years, if necessary alone.** At any rate, that is what we are going to try to do. That is the resolve of His Majesty's Government-every man of them. That is the will of Parliament and the nation. The British Empire and the French Republic, linked together in their cause and in their need, will defend to the death their native soil, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength. Even though large tracts of Europe and many old and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not flag or fail. *We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender*, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this Island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God's good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.",2,1,1,"“In War: Resolution,
In Defeat: Defiance,
In Victory: Magnanimity

democrats,controversial,An apology to all those who we've let down,"I wanted to share something yesterday, and I really thought about it long and hard, I just want you to understand my pain and anguish about the aftermath of what happened:

Tuesday night, I went home and went to bed hoping against hope that this red monster, would never ever get back in the white house. When I woke up Wednesday morning and saw the final results, that's when my rage exploded! I've been crying ever since.

 I am not only angry, I am absolutely furious with every single citizen who has betrayed America to the fullest by voting for Donald Trump because of so-called money! They say greed is good, it is not!

 Money and greed are the root of all evils! I was fighting for @kamalaharris because I wanted to fight for the people especially those with physical and mental needs who have not been heard! And now, with this monster back in the White House to become dictator, my greatest fear is that our rights as individuals with special needs will be totally destroyed and taken away for good. This is my heartbreaking fear and something I wish I did not have to say.

I also have something to say to all the women who I fought so very hard for in trying to protect their right to their own choices: words alone cannot express my deepest grief, nor my deepest sorrow, as to how much I and many others have failed to stop this monster, and I cannot tell you how sorry I am enough! 😔😭

But I am not going to give up fighting but I am going to fight like absolute furious hell in more ways than one. And not only that, but I'm going to hold all those accountable in the name of justice, by calling them out and acknowledging their guilt for turning their back on this country and not electing a woman as president of the United States.... Again! 

It happened before in 2016 when we had Hillary Clinton concede to Donald Trump and now Kamala! As an autistic person, I am very disappointed, very angry, and outraged, there is going to be a day of great atoning coming when they realize that Trump is the liar and deceiver of all humankind. And I will say to them, ""see, I told you so!""

democrats,controversial,"The line is drawn. We need to double down, not lay down!",,12,7,5,"The gloves have to come off. 

All I keep seeing today is all of this ""doom and gloom"" and people giving up the fight left and right.

We lost. We got punched in the mouth and we're on the mat. Democracy in getting the 10-count as we speak. Are we going to just lay on the mat, let the count expire and lose for good? Or are we going to get up and take the fight back to them? If this was reversed do you think they would just lay down and take it? When they lost in 2020, did they just lay down and take it? No. They damn near pulled off a coup.

Now I'm not saying we need to do a coup. I'm not even saying we need a protest. I'm saying we all need to stop moping around like a bunch of giant pussies. We need to regroup and figure out how we're going to prevent them from completely screwing over America even more over the next four years. We need figure out who we're going get behind for 2028. We need to figure out how we're gonna take the house and senate in 2026. And we need to figure out how we can beat them going forward, because the current playbook aint working!

Dems need to stop messing around with this ""nice guy"" shit. Nice guys finish last and Republicans have not been playing nice for a long time. The DNC leaders need to start learning from mistakes instead of repeating them. Hillary losing to Trump in 2016 proved that America wasn't ready for a female president. Why did we not learn this lesson? Why did we gamble that maybe America doesn't really have a misogyny problem and play it back again this time? Why did we make it even harder by putting a non-white woman up this time?

We did it because she was the obvious best candidate in short notice. She also was probably the most deserving given the situation. We did it because we learned nothing in 2016. We did it because all things considered, it was the nice and right thing to do.

But as the saying goes: Nice guys finish last. And I can tell you, being a nice guy my whole life, there is a lot of truth to this statement.

Do you know who isn't nice and doesn't play nice? Trump and MAGA. That's who. They didn't play nice. They acted like outright assholes, and the reaped the rewards that play yielded against an opponent playing the ""nice card"". We were honestly LUCKY we won in 2020. The only reason we did was because of how recent the Trump shit show was at that time. Four years removed, people forgot, because that's what people do.

As a white male it kills me to say this because I love women and I see women as equal. I see everyone that way. But Kamala was never going to win because of her gender and race. I knew it the day Joe dropped out. I hoped I was wrong but it turns out I was right.

Going forward, it's my opinion that we need a candidate like Jon Stewart for 2028. I know he says he doesn't want it, but that's exactly why he should get it. He's a prime candidate in my eyes and I know he would do a good job, because all it takes to do good job is to TRY to do a good job, and I know he would. If we can't get Jon, we need someone as charismatic and smart as Jon and he unfortunately needs to be straight white man. Don't get me twisted. As far as establishment candidates go, I would love Buttigieg (I even have a PETE 2020 shirt I still wear), but at this point I cannot trust he would win just because he happens to be gay. We're at that point now. It sucks. But here we are. We have to play the safe candidate for the next few cycles. We cant risk misogyny, homophobia, or racism be the reason we lose. We need to be smart and long play this if we want to win.",13,2024-11-07 01:11:49,2024-11-07 01:23:45,0.5

democrats,controversial,How to Win.,"I'm a nobody. Simple 'federal' employee making not enough. Married and desperately trying to start our family. I'm a die hard blue democrat too. Young, white male. Logic and reason is paramount to how I think. So take what I suggest with a grain of salt perhaps.

So. 

HOW TO WIN.


First things first tho, about Kamala. 

I'm sure she is a real-ass person, a lady and overall lovely human being. A fierce prosecutor. And firm AG. A brilliant senator. And a fine VP. Just not good enough to the masses. The media bobbled it totally, maybe on purpose. She got railroaded. He of course, they love to shine a turd, don't they???

Anyway.

It's all about selling a candidate to the audience, right? 

In this outrageous media and political climate, it's all imagery. The masses want someone in particular, they just don't know it yet.

The DNC needs an ace down in the farm system. LITERALLY.

They need to find a mid to late 30's or early 40's straight white male. He HAS to be a lawyer. A real good one too. Smart. Charismatic. Sharp as a tack. Good-looking. And a good dad and eagle scout husband. No bones in his closet.

And finally, he has to be a democrat thru and thru. Well, sorta. Maybe with moderate leanings to simple palatable policies. Immigration. Simple capitalist economics. Liberty and personal sovereignty. That type of shit. Easy to market.

He has to be from a small to medium-sized city. 150,000 to 370,000 population city. A bluish or purplish city. IN A RED STATE.

Not an activist. But a guy that cares for his clients. Taking up good causes and cases. 

You offer him the position. Hopefully he says yes. 

Then you POUR MONEY into campaigning his local 2026 house campaign.

Trump 2.0 backed by that dipshit Musk is gonna tear the economy apart. 100%

So you run him. This John Smith III.

He charms the dumb masses with his down home attitude. His laser sharp clarity reaches into their dumb little heads and grabs em! He simplifies the issues they are dealing with. And offers simple, reasonable solutions to the chaos. 

John Smith III wins his seat in the US House. 

As America grinds to a halt and panic world over ensues, you POUR MONEY into his media debut. Boost the ever-loving fuck out of him. Show him fighting for his constituents. Tearing apart the GOP and the idiocy of all their plans. He needs to be a political pitbull.

Then you capture the masses of morons that obviously inhabit our wonderful country. 

And you run him in 2028.

THAT'S HOW YOU FUCKING WIN.

",2,1,1,"No. 

People need to wake up and understand that the Republicans weaponized rhetoric.  And weaponized rhetoric is one of the most powerful weapons of humanity. 

So Trump and his surrogates created this fictional reality about who he is, what he would do for voters, and who Harris was. While also sowing mistrust and confusion. 

So another candidate? They would have adjusted the fictional narrative.

I'm sure she is a real-ass person, a lady and overall lovely human being. A fierce prosecutor. And firm AG. A brilliant senator. And a fine VP. Just not good enough to the masses. The media bobbled it totally, maybe on purpose. She got railroaded. He of course, they love to shine a turd, don't they???

Anyway.

It's all about selling a candidate to the audience, right? 

In this outrageous media and political climate, it's all imagery. The masses want someone in particular, they just don't know it yet.

The DNC needs an ace down in the farm system. LITERALLY.

They need to find a mid to late 30's or early 40's straight white male. He HAS to be a lawyer. A real good one too. Smart. Charismatic. Sharp as a tack. Good-looking. And a good dad and eagle scout husband. No bones in his closet.

And finally, he has to be a democrat thru and thru. Well, sorta. Maybe with moderate leanings to simple palatable policies. Immigration. Simple capitalist economics. Liberty and personal sovereignty. That type of shit. Easy to market.

He has to be from a small to medium-sized city. 150,000 to 370,000 population city. A bluish or purplish city. IN A RED STATE.

Not an activist. But a guy that cares for his clients. Taking up good causes and cases. 

You offer him the position. Hopefully he says yes. 

Then you POUR MONEY into campaigning his local 2026 house campaign.

Trump 2.0 backed by that dipshit Musk is gonna tear the economy apart. 100%

So you run him. This John Smith III.

He charms the dumb masses with his down home attitude. His laser sharp clarity reaches into their dumb little heads and grabs em! He simplifies the issues they are dealing with. And offers simple, reasonable solutions to the chaos. 

John Smith III wins his seat in the US House. 

As America grinds to a halt and panic world over ensues, you POUR MONEY into his media debut. Boost the ever-loving fuck out of him. Show him fighting for his constituents. Tearing apart the GOP and the idiocy of all their plans. He needs to be a political pitbull.

Then you capture the masses of morons that obviously inhabit our wonderful country. 

And you run him in 2028.

THAT'S HOW YOU FUCKING WIN.

",2,1,1,"or we can acknowledge that they're going to call us radicals either way so we might as well run an actual radical, because clearly it's working for them - Trump's popularity has a lot more to do with working-class Americans being dissatisfied with the status quo than any other single factor, and Democrats are losing because we've been running status quo candidates. We need somebody who brings the same kind of charisma and radicalism as Trump, but fueled by solutions rather than scapegoats. otherwise we'll just keep hemorrhaging voters trying to appeal to non-existent never trumpers and alienating the progressive wing of the party",4,2024-11-08 04:44:57,2024-11-08 12:02:58,0.6
democrats,controversial,How to Win.,"I'm a nobody. Simple 'federal' employee making not enough. Married and desperately trying to start our family. I'm a die hard blue democrat too. Young, white male. Logic and reason is paramount to how I think. So take what I suggest with a grain of salt perhaps.

So.

The BLUF though is that I cannot agree more. We need more folks on the left to present a decent version of masculinity. 

First i think ot should be said that the majority of young men, especially, have no issues with gender rights. Could it be that the democratic party doesn't and isn't speaking with them? If you look at the communities the democratic official states it serves (https://democrats.org/who-we-are/who-we-serve/), there is no explicit mention of men or young men... I mean objectively speaking how are young men suposed to recieve that message as anything other then you don't belong with us. If we want to win im 2026 and 2028, we need to understand where the root of the issues lie, why, and how to address them.

Im not saying hey let's bring down women either. Women need to be lifted up and celebrated for there victories. But you are fooling yourself if you think that we cant lift up young men as well as women. 

A few more stats for to think over. 

women graduate from college at a 2:1 ratio compared men. It should be celebrated that women are achieving such rates, buuuutt the question needs to be ask why is the male number so low?

Men are 3x as likely to  kill themselves 

Men are 5x more likely to be incarcerated

The majority of homelessness are men

SCOTUS replaced by a jury system of federal and appellate judges. Judges still chosen by President with approval from Congress. Judges must be decided on by a yes or no vote within 45 days of nomination.

2. No official is immune to the law, as the other poster wrote. Has to have stipulations to prevent a antagonistic congress, but more accessible than impeachment is in our split society.

3. Senate is chosen by state legislatures, gerrymandering is unconstitutional even for the states in favor of independent mathematical districting (or proportional representation).

4. Donations to politicians, PACS, or other election influencing parties do not count as limited speech, must be made public, and are limited in dollar amount. Money is not speech, Corporations are not people and can be limited by the states.

5. When the two lowest state populations decline to a certain proportion of the largest two states, the larger states gain an additional senator up to two 6 year terms before the census may reapportion those senators.

6. Anti-trust powers enshrined in the constitution to give both the federal government and states the power to restrict monopolies.

7. all of the existing amendments (2nd included, though could be rewritten to have less goofy language).

8. Enshrine the VRA and CRA as amendments to protect minority representations.

9. President does not have the authority to fire officials below the cabinet, nor the cabinet the power to fire said officials, without approval from congress. Congress can write legislation to enable or restrict firings (enshrine Humphrey's executor and the power of other independent agencies to be protected from political overreach). Congress can establish organizations that are completely independent of the President/Executive, such as oversight agencies (IGs, labor data, FTC, FEC, etc.)

10. I'm honestly kind of okay with a president/PM split responsibility.

11. Racial and sexual discrimination is prohibited, and enshrine the right to privacy (and subsequently abortion/medical choice). Consider right to privacy extends to digital/electronic private information being paid out to the user if any monetary gain is attributed to said data (corporate data eminent domain).",10,2025-10-10 04:41:31,2025-10-10 05:33:49,0.9

conservatives,hot,"Democrats Attempt to Cast Blame on Trump, Republicans for Schumer Shutdown",,20,16,4,"Actually that's not true.  I don't care for the democrats, but this one falls squarely on the GOP as they have the majority in the House, Senate, and have the presidency and could use the nuclear option.  They've also had since July 4th after signing the BBB to come up with a budget.  Continuing Resolutions have become the norm instead of passing a budget.  In addition, even if a budget is passed, does it mean anything at all if the president  impounds or repurposes the money?  Even GOP members have complained about the repurposing and the impounding as no one knows where that money is going.

I believe we are going down a slippery slope if we cannot start working with the Democrats (and Independent(s)) to govern our country and to pass a balanced budget.  This us vs them needs to stop and we need to do what is best of the nation, not the party. I don't believe in healthcare being provided by the government because than we are going down a socialist path that drives up taxes.  The ACA is not sustainable, but the GOP stated in Trump's first term that they had a plan for healthcare, which did not materialize.  In Trump's campaign for the second term he had the ""concepts of a plan,"" but again there is no alternative provided to the ACA.  Just cancelling or doing away with the ACA will ultimately drive up healthcare costs for everyone.  Both parties need to come up with a solution!

I know this is not a popular viewpoint, but if we keep going down this path of inflexibility and spending, we will be bankrupt and the dollar will loose its value.  If you look at how fast the national debt is rising, we should be worried.  The tax cuts that were provided to the rich has an impact on the deficit which cannot be made up by tariffs.  Simple economics show that we are headed in the wrong direction despite the stock market gains.  

Every president since the 1980s has added to the national deficit and it has grown dramatically.  The interest we pay on borrowed money has doubled and our bond rating has gone down making future borrowings more expensive.  Warning signs are all around.

Another good graph shows that both Biden and Trump increased the deficit [https://usadebtnow.org/presidents](https://usadebtnow.org/presidents) so the blame lies with both parties.

Let’s be honest: the J6 defendants did get due process. They had hearings, trials, lawyers, appeals. We can debate whether some charges were excessive, but to call them hostages is wrong and cheapens what real injustice actually looks like.

And let me say this plainly as former LE: anyone who attacked officers that day doesn’t get my sympathy. I’ve worn the badge. If you assault law enforcement, you're not a patriot. You're a criminal. Period.

J6 prisoner held 1,000 days without trial; Details abuses  

Jake Lang — he has been held in jail for 1,000 days without a trial.

Lang told The Epoch Times that Jan. 6 prisoners are frequently denied family visitation. They spend months with no sunlight. Lights in their cells remain on at night in order to deprive them of sleep. 

He wasn’t given soap, so the oil ran down his body to his groin where the burning became excruciating. In his cell, the burning oil transferred to his mattress. He woke from nightmares thinking he was on fire.

When he was thrown back in “the hole,” he went on a 12-day hunger strike that cost him 30 pounds.

Negotiations for ending his hunger strike included a haircut, family visitation, and a Congressional investigation into the deaths of Ashli Babbitt and Rosanne Boyland.

J6 prisoner held 1,000 days without trial; Details abuses,  prisoners are frequently

• denied family visitation
• spend months with no sunlight
• Lights in their cells remain on at night in order to deprive them of sleep.

“I’ve done 20 months of solitary confinement,” the 28-year-old said.

At one point, after serving months in solitary confinement, Land said he was moved back to a section within the D.C. facility that holds a small number of prisoners. He said his fellow Jan. 6 prisoners gathered at his cell door to greet him.

“One of the guards yelled for them to get away from my door, just arbitrarily enforcing a rule that didn’t exist,” he told The Epoch Times. The guard then “called the sergeant, who opened the door and unloaded a whole can of military-grade pepper spray directly into my eyes.”

Naked and in cuffs, an emergency response team dragged him from the cell and brought him to a shower. Female guards watched, “laughing hysterically” at his pain, Lang said.

He wasn’t given soap, so the oil ran down his body to his groin where the burning became excruciating. In his cell, the burning oil transferred to his mattress. He woke from nightmares thinking he was on fire.
