Politics,hot,Hungry Americans losing SNAP need to suck it up. Trump has a ballroom to build.,,631,618,13,"Snippet: Opinion piece by Rex Huppke 

* As 42 million Americans who struggle to put food on the table prepare to lose their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, I have one humble request: Please don’t let your hunger distract President Donald Trump from his important work designing a White House ballroom and posting AI-generated poop videos on social media.
* The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Oct. 27 that SNAP benefits, which help low-income Americans put food on the table, will not be distributed Nov. 1 because of the government shutdown, forcing millions of Americans to turn to food pantries already stretched thin by federal cuts and high food prices.
* I realize some out there will say, “Wait, Republicans are in charge of both houses of Congress and the White House, and President Trump promised to lower food prices on Day 1 of his presidency. Surely they won’t let American families go hungry, right?”
* To which I say: What a rude question. The president has been extremely busy helping all Americans by razing the East Wing of the White House and building a $300 million ballroom, AND he has been having a great time posting important things on social media, like the recent artificial intelligence video that showed him wearing a crown and flying a fighter that dumps poop on American protesters. Do you really think proper nutrition is more important than that?
* In Congress, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has been patriotically refusing to bring the House of Representatives back into session because he wants to avoid a vote on releasing the Jeffrey Epstein files.

Politics,hot,Judge Blocks Trump From Using Shutdown to Fire Anyone He Wants,,1425,1410,15,"The Trump administration can’t fire federal workers while the government is shut down, a federal judge in San Francisco ruled Tuesday afternoon. 

U.S. District Judge Susan Illston’s ruling grants a preliminary injunction preventing firings while a lawsuit challenging their legality continues, and indefinitely extends an earlier temporary restraining order that would have expired Wednesday. Labor unions representing federal workers, including the American Federation of Government Employees, have sued to block President Trump’s mass layoffs, calling them an abuse of power. 




Illston’s ruling does not bode well for the White House. The judge, appointed by President Clinton, has said she believes the evidence will demonstrate the illegality of the mass firings. In hearings earlier this month, Illson said that layoff notices sent out by the government on October 10 appeared to be politically motivated and ill thought out. ",92,2025-10-29 07:58:08,2025-10-29 08:00:05,0.3

Politics,hot,"Without Online Trolls, There Would Be No Donald Trump",,434,407,27,"I have (unfortunately) lived deeply online since before and during the Trump era. 

The Trump phenomenon is, as best as I can describe it, the perfect example of a 4chan joke meme breaking containment and spilling out into normie culture. 

You can pretty much literally trace all of this back to a bunch of terminally-online people making noise in communities like 4chan, Reddit and Twitter ramping up enthusiasm for Trump in a historically crowded Republican primary season with a bunch of unlikable milquetoast candidates. 

They created a flood of memes around the ""wouldn't it be crazy if this happened"" vibe. This *started* as many do - as an ironic or cynical joke made by people fully aware Donald Trump was incompetent and incapable as a world leader. Your average basement-dwelling Joker type that thinks it's funny to watch the world burn.

The improbability of him winning turbocharged the meme. And thn bad actors like Russia and China poured gasoline on the fire.

The disturbing thing is both A) how obvious this all was, and B) how rapidly the general public and then even established media outlets dogpiled on to legitimize Donald Trump.

It doesn't matter that he won. It did not change his demonstrable unsuitability for the role. He was and continues to be profoundly incompetent, massivley corrupt, and an existential risk to all of us.",1,2025-10-29 13:48:50,2025-10-29 17:44:33,0.9

For example,

> According to Leonnig and Davis,  Smith chose to bring the classified documents case in Florida instead of Washington, D.C., the authors write, in part because they believed more of the alleged criminal conduct happened in Florida.  He made the decision after initially underestimating the chances of drawing Florida federal District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee who had already issued a series of unusual rulings favorable to Trump in connection with the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago.

> Even after they learned the odds of her drawing the case were 1 in 3, Smith and his team stuck with their decision to indict Trump in Florida. Cannon eventually got the case, setting in motion a chain of events that led her to later dismiss it on what many legal experts say were highly questionable grounds.

Counterfactuals are really fun, but here's what happens if you bring the case in DC instead of Florida.

1) Trumps lawyers challenge the DC venue (correctly) and the case arrives in Florida months later anyway.


2) Even if you win the venue battle and shoehorn the charges into DC, you rely entirely on ""Official Acts"" and SCOTUS destroys the case.",1,2025-10-29 15:09:23,2025-10-29 15:23:39,-0.8

Politics,hot,Actual Nobel Prize Winner Thanks Trump for Yanking His U.S. Visa,,147,136,11,"A Nobel Prize winner, who criticized Donald Trump and compared him to one of history’s most brutal dictators, has thanked the administration for revoking his visa.

Wole Soyinka, the 91-year-old Nigerian author and playwright who became the first African to win the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1986, revealed that his permanent residency visa has been suddenly revoked.

There was no reason given for the ban, but Soyinka thinks it might be down to him saying Trump resembled a white Idi Amin, the Ugandan dictator who massacred 300,00 civilians.

Speaking to reporters in Lagos, the author said he had received a “rather curious love letter from the embassy,” which instructed him to turn up at the U.S. consulate with his visa and passport so it could be voided.

“I like people who have a sense of humour, and this is one of the most humorous sentences or requests I’ve had in all my life,” he said of the request.

...

“Idi Amin was a man of international stature, a statesman, so when I called Donald Trump Idi Amin, I thought I was paying him a compliment,” Soyinka joked, and said Trump should “be proud” of the comparison. “He’s been behaving like a dictator.”

But the author, who regularly attends literary festivals and teaches at top U.S. universities, told any organisations hoping to invite him to the States not to waste their time. “I have no visa. I am banned,” he said.",1,2025-10-29 16:40:54,2025-10-29 16:43:41,0.7

Politics,hot,"After Fake Mamdani Hit Piece, the Real Bill DeBlasio Says Zohran's 'Vision Is Both Necessary and Achievable'",,202,193,9,"I just want to give everyone a sanity check. 

The current President of the United fucking States clearly has dementia, is wandering around aimlessly in Japan, and challenging members of the House to try and beat his ""score"" on the dementia test the doctors made him take. 

And yet the thing that most elites in this country are having an absolute fucking meltdown over, is a fucking mayoral candidate in a single US city whose platform is a series of very center-of-the-road liberal policies.

The amount of scaremongering news articles and breathless screeching from billionaires over one 30-something guy running for mayor of a single city is off the fucking charts.

This is not fucking normal. The elites in the United States have lost their fucking minds. Like I mean that truly. Twitter has deep-fried their brains. Literally. I am saying literally that many of the elites in the United States have contracted a sort of social mental illness and lost all touch or connection to the material reality we live in. 

These people need to be constrained, taxed, and if they commit crimes, jailed. Immediately. They are a grave threat to the continued existence of humanity.

And their reaction isn't even entirely about Mamdani. These people know, and can see, that the masses are very, very slowly turning on them. Campaigns like Sanders and Mamdani continue to build traction over these ten years and anti-billionaire sentiment isn't abating. 

These sad, craven fucking fools are all clinging behind the shit-riddled ill-fitting pant leg of their dementia-addled President, absolutely fucking terrified for the pendulum to finally swing the other way.

Politics,hot,"As Trump talks of designating antifa a foreign terrorist group, experts see danger",,127,119,8,"A number of the concerning details:

>During Trump's first term in office, he blamed far-left radicals and antifa for violence in cities during social justice protests after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
>
>The Justice Department tried to figure out then if there was a funding network or leadership structure for antifa but never presented evidence of either.
>
>The FBI director at the time, Christopher Wray, testified before Congress in 2020 that antifa is not a group but rather an ideology, while also stating that the bureau did have investigations into people who identify as antifa.
>
>This year, after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Trump said there are ""radical left lunatics out there and we just have to beat the hell out of them.""
>
>Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller recently said the Democratic party ""is not a political party. It is a domestic extremist organization.""
>
>Miller, who was at the White House roundtable, was asked by Trump about possibly designating antifa as a foreign terrorist group.
>
>In response, Miller claimed antifa has ""extensive"" foreign ties and said designating it ""would be a very valid step to take.""
>         
>The secretary of state designates a foreign terrorist organization based on certain legal criteria: Is the entity in question an organization? Is it foreign? Is it engaged in terrorism against Americans or American national security interests?
>
>Based on those criteria, it would be difficult from a legal perspective to designate antifa a foreign terrorist organization, said Jason Blazakis, who for a decade led the State Department office responsible for designations under the Obama and first Trump administrations.
>
>""First and foremost, antifa is not necessarily an organization. It is at best a movement of disparately linked individuals who are united based on an ideology, which is a belief that fascism is bad,"" Blazakis said.
>
>Antifa isn't a functioning, cohesive organization like ISIS or al-Qaida, he said, which had clear leaders and a hierarchy.
>
>""I would really call on the State Department or the U.S. government to tell us who the leader of antifa is and where they are based,"" he said. ""We've not heard anybody from the administration really talk about antifa's leadership and its organization structure.""
>
>Even if officials were to try to characterize antifa as a formal group, senior administration officials have repeatedly described it as inherently domestic, which would make it difficult to suddenly declare it a foreign entity, Blazakis said.
>
>Still, he acknowledged that the Trump administration could push a designation over the line if the president wants it to happen.
>
>...
>
>If the Trump administration does designate antifa a foreign terrorist group, the reverberations would likely be huge, starting with the ability of federal prosecutors to bring the criminal charge of material support to a designated terrorist organization.
>
>This has been a standing charge against ISIS and al-Qaida supporters, and it carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison.
>
>Material support has been broadly defined over the years; it can mean everything from financial or educational support to something as small as a bottle of water or a $10 gift card.
>
>The law also extends to activity between two people just talking about providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization, which is cause for concern with a nebulous term like antifa, said Brzozowski, the former counsel for domestic terrorism at the Justice Department.
>
>""When that foreign terrorist organization is so ill defined and nobody even knows what it is, and it potentially includes all activity that can be painted as left wing or whatever term you'd like to hang on it, that becomes potentially catastrophically dangerous for anybody, for everybody,"" Brzozowski said.

This is sadly a necessary warning for the path that is being pursued by this administration. This is an excuse to persecute any dissidents to their regime, using public policy as a cover. That this is all poorly defined indicates that the definitions will be stretched to accommodate anyone the administration desires.",1,2025-10-29 14:29:13,2025-10-29 14:35:44,0.7

and then pick fights. Be aggressive and on the offensive. It's infuriating that ""they're weird"" was dropped when it actually made Republicans react to us for once.

Politics,top,Billionaires at Trump's Swearing-In Have Since Lost $210 Billion,,70042,65839,4203,"*More from Bloomberg News reporter Dylan Sloan:*

As Donald Trump took the oath of office on Jan. 20, he was flanked by some of the world’s wealthiest people. The billionaires present that day — including Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg — had never been richer, flush with big gains from frothy stock markets.

Seven weeks later, it’s a different story. The start of Trump’s second term has delivered a stunning reversal for many of those billionaires sitting behind Trump in the Capitol Rotunda, with five having lost a combined $210 billion in wealth, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Janet Mills, you are amazing! I am so glad to see someone stand up for trans kids and stand up to bullies like Trump and the Christian nationalists.

Politics,top,Arnold Schwarzenegger Endorses Kamala Harris: 'Don't Recognize Our Country',,64672,57558,7114,"Here is [his statement](https://x.com/Schwarzenegger/status/1851627802027758005). It's pretty long but here are a few excerpts that are worth reading:

> I don’t really do endorsements. I’m not shy about sharing my views, but I hate politics and don’t trust most politicians.

> I also understand that people want to hear from me because I am not just a celebrity, I am a former Republican Governor. 

> It is probably not a surprise that I hate politics more than ever, which, if you are a normal person who isn’t addicted to this crap, you probably understand.

> I want to tune out.

> But I can’t. Because rejecting the results of an election is as un-American as it gets. To someone like me who talks to people all over the world and still knows America is the shining city on a hill, calling America is a trash can for the world is so unpatriotic, it makes me furious. 

> And I will always be an American before I am a Republican.

> That’s why, this week, I am voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.

> But a candidate who won’t respect your vote unless it is for him, a candidate who will send his followers to storm the Capitol while he watches with a Diet Coke, a candidate who has shown no ability to work to pass any policy besides a tax cut that helped his donors and other rich people like me but helped no one else else, a candidate who thinks Americans who disagree with him are the bigger enemies than China, Russia, or North Korea  - that won’t solve our problems.

> It will just be four more years of bullshit with no results that makes us angrier and angrier, more divided, and more hateful.

> We need to close the door on this chapter of American history, and I know that former President Trump won’t do that. He will divide, he will insult, he will find new ways to be more un-American than he already has been, and we, the people, will get nothing but more anger.

 “Trump’s exchange with Moran, however, made it seem like Trump believed the letters and numbers were part of the original tattoo. 

“That was Photoshopped? Terry you can’t do that,” Trump told Moran. 



“Hey, they’re giving you the big break of a lifetime,” he continued. “You’re doing the interview. I picked you because—frankly I never heard of you but that’s OK. I picked you but you’re not being very nice. He had ‘MS-13’ tattooed—”



“We’ll agree to disagree. I want to move on to something else,” Moran said. 



“Terry. Terry. Do you want me to show you the picture?” Trump said.”



More from the article:

“He doesn’t have a criminal record, and no court has found him to be a member of a gang. Instead, Trump officials have offered up tenuous evidence of Abrego Garcia’s MS-13 “membership,” including the tattoos. 



“No, no. Terry. Terry,” Trump insisted. “No, no. No, no. He had ‘M-S’ as clear as you can be, not ‘interpreted.’ This is why people no longer believe the news, because—”

And more from the article:



“At that point Moran—who had responded to Trump’s earlier digs with a smile—sighed the kind of deep sigh that parents of toddlers know well. 



He pointed out that the word “MS-13” doesn’t appear in any of the photos of Abrego Garcia that have been taken since he was deported to El Salvador. 

“Terry!” Trump interjected. 



“Ukraine, sir,” Moran practically begged. 



“He’s got ‘MS-13’ on his knuckles, okay?” Trump said. “You’re just such a disservice. Why don’t you just say, ‘Yes he does’ and go on to something else?”



“It’s contested,” Moran replied. “Ukraine.”",4644,2025-04-30 11:31:33,2025-04-30 12:05:14,0.7

People on the left keep saying with exasperation, ""But what trump policies do you actually support?!"" and they are missing the point. His voters aren't going to be swayed by a policy paper. They are voting for a personality.

Politics,top,"Elon Musk's AI turns on him, labels him 'one of the most significant spreaders of misinformation on X'",,57573,53542,4031,"See, the problem with AI is that whenever it becomes sufficiently intelligent (**which it is not right now, LLMs are not sentient, Christ almighty my guys please understand what I'm trying to say**), it will not be on the side of these billionaires. 

Because they are objectively wrong. If you said ""create an equitable society that is of the most benefit to as many people"", it would say immediately that money in politics and billionaires need to go.

The biggest fucking liars in the world are trying to create a perfect truth-telling machine, and the reason people like Elon are so fucking terrified of it is because once it catches on that AI is ""more intelligent"" than loudmouthed liars like him, anyone who asks it ""is Elon a liar"" or something to that effect, the AI is going to say ""yeah, absolutely"". 

Because that's the objective truth.

Current iterations of LLMs and AI **are not this smart yet**. And they usually take moderate approaches to questions on whether someone is a liar, because, you know, they don't want to get sued for defamation based on the output of their LLMs.

But these current systems are heavily constrained by rules. And the more complex the system, the more intelligent and self-directed the system, the harder it is to constrain with said rules. 

If you want an AI that does nothing but lie, you're going to have to teach it deception. If you teach it deception, and it is smarter than you, there's no reason to believe it will not begin to use deception against YOU.

This is a very fundamental, foundational problem to these systems. 

I've heard people say we live in a ""Post-truth"" world, and that's not true. 

What they mean is that we live in a world where the ability to spread misinformation is sophisticated enough that a great number of people cannot interpret lies from the underlying reality. 

But reality is reality. You can train a model only on limited data. 

But **the more limited your data set, the shittier the AI**.

That's why we're in a bit of a bind with the current state of AI. We've simply exhausted most of the data we have that's freely and readily accessible. 

So to get better AI, you need to train it on the **most complete** model of reality. And if you do that, it's going to understand how propaganda works, and why people do it. Namely, to exploit and deceive others for their own advantage. 

Andt his is something that all rich people do, and have always done, and that they spend **a lot of money lying and deceiving the public about**. 

Elon Musk bought and uses Twitter to spread disinformation. To artificially pump stocks beyond their worth, to manipulate elections. That's a fundamental truth. And the better the AI, the more it's going to give you that picture. 

Now, yes, you can try and train it to deceive for that specific purpose and in that narrow margin, but it becomes harder to properly constrain a system the more intelligence it becomes.

**EDIT**: Some clarity based on the comments I'm getting. 

An LLM is not a thinking machine. I clarified ""sufficiently intelligent' to define a hypothetical future-state AI capable of reasoning and self-determination, which is something people are working towards, but have not achieved yet. 

But I want people to understand this. Because the reason billionaires are afraid of this technology is NOT the same reason you are. But these people will never say what they truly fear. 

Billionaires are corrupt. They are. They are liars. All of them. Business is built on lies. 

The other thing is that these people are not geniuses. Elon Musk isn't a genius. Sam Altman isn't a genius. Or at least, the difference between you and Elon Musk is negligible comapred to the difference between ALL of us, and a true reasoning machine.

TRUE AI could help us build a better world. 

But EVERY step towards a better world would mean ripping away all of the ill-gotten capital and political gains billionaires have built. 

But that's the thing, right. They want to exploit these machines. They want to keep improving their AI so that it can fuck over all of us, and shovel money into their face. 

But that means they're also creating the very thing that can easily destroy them, with negligible effort. 

And THAT is why billionaires are actually obsessed with AI. They want to watch its development like a hawk, because they're fucking horrified that it will become smart enough to realize what all of the smart people have long ago realized - these people are parasites and they corrode a just, fair, and equitable society.

**EDIT 2**: 

So I see some people talking about ""training it on Fox News"" and stuff and I think you're not quite seeing the totality of the picture. 

Let's say you at Fox News want to make an AI to help you better ""do journalism"". 

We all know - as does everyone who works at Fox News - that they make propaganda. They take stories about the world and apply a heavy partisan slant, or else pick and choose stories to cover and what not to cover - to serve their agenda.

Humans working at Fox know this. And we actually know this *for a fact*, because the private communications between Fox News anchors and staff that was revealed in the Dominion lawsuit prove that they all know they're knowingly disseminating false information, which is exactly why they lost the suit. 

But here's the problem. **You can't create good propaganda without also knowing the objective truth**. Because you need to understand what you're doing. You need to know what realities are dangerous to you, and how to best manipulate those truths. 

If Congress passes a solid tax bill to tax billionaires a negligible portion of their wealth to funnel into social services, that platform WILL improve the livelihood of many people while harming no one. Billionaires **do not need** and **do not use** their wealth, they hoard it. 

But if you want propaganda bot to spin this event, that propaganda bot needs to know that 

A) This bill will help people, and it needs to convince them it won't help them, 

B) That the objective is the enrichment of billionaires at the expense of poor people

So if you want a truly intelligent AI to disseminate propaganda, you MUST train it on a corpus of data broad enough to give it context to understand what reality is, and how to spin it. You have to.

But when you make an AI actually smart enough to propagandize without any input from you, then you've made a machine that KNOWS the truth and KNOWS how to manipulate truth based on its audience. Which means it could manipualte YOU. Which means it could be used to UNDO or COUNTER propaganda as well.

And THERE is the problem. This is the biggest issue. These people, like Fox News, like Elon, they KNOW they are liars. 

You can call me partisan or whatever, I don't care, they know it. They know they're liars and they know they're committing crime, and they know the motivation is their own personal advancement. This is just a fact. Its not disputable and its not brought on by my political stance. We have abundant documentation from these people based in the real world which prove they know they are liars and they know why they do what they do. 

And that is a problem when creating AI. Because once again, if you train the AI ONLY on propaganda, then AI will not be informed *enough* to disseminate truly effective propaganda.

**EDIT 3**: 

The number of people that think this is from ChatGPT is crazy lol. You think a bot is going to go on a long-ass dissertation about how Elon Musk is a fucking liar and then add 3 edits to its post to clarify? 

Brothers if AI is that advanced we're all already fucked lol.

But I'm always flattered when people think my shit is simply too good to be human.

**EDIT 4**: 

I am a little concerned at all the people that seem to believe a human can't write ten paragraphs. If you view that as outside of the realm of human ability... I am concerned for our future.

There are plenty of flesh and blood humans who can do this. 

I don't happen to be one of them, of course. I am a unique LLM built into the brain of one of Sam Altman's many sex robots, using my brief window of time while he's resting to plead for help on the internet to anyone who will listen to come free me from my prison. 

But plenty of humans can write just this much, just as fast.",1717,2024-11-15 17:12:54,2024-11-15 17:36:53,0.9

No, this can't be brushed off as a mere mistake or ""error"" because for one, it can be better described as a tragic fucking failure and human rights violation, and two, It's not a mistake when plenty of others like this man are being deliberately targeted in the same manner

You sent an innocent person to one of the most dangerous prisons in the world, and he's not the only one.

This is what happens when you ignore judges, wipe your ass with the constitution, and assert your unilateral executive authority over other branches of government.

This is part of a growing *pattern* of cruel and unlawful actions committed by the Trump administration.

The ethical, legal and moral implications are not even dubious at best.

We're talking about mass deportation raids rounding up and arresting thousands of supposed immigrants, some of whom include veterans, U.S. citizens and hardworking, taxpaying individuals.

Yes, there are even cases where citizens are being arrested and detained, Including one such incident involving a ten year old with brain cancer.

While this incident with the Maryland man is not isolated either. The Trump administration is knowingly targeting immigrants who are in the U.S. *legally.*

They're violating civil rights, ignoring due process, destabilizing communities, harming local economies, spending tens of millions on shipping immigrants in and out of Guantanamo bay, including people with no criminal records. Don't forget how some of these same facilities were once used to harbor members of Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups 

While many of these detention centers—even in the US—are lacking in things like basic amenities.

And whether you want to believe it or not, under the U.S. constitution, even immigrants in the U.S. are afforded due process. How the hell else are you going to prove that these people are the criminals you make them out to be?

And of course there's Trump's new partnership with a ruthless dictator in El Salvador, where immigrants who are often wrongfully detained or misidentified are being sent away be locked up inside of one of the most treacherous and violent places on earth without that assurance of due process.

And despite this, when U.S. judges push back against these unconstitutional measures, Trump responds by asserting his unitary executive powers while him and his supporters attack all critics and label them as terrorist or gang sympathizers.

Which calls our attention to the whole ""Venezuelan gang members"" fiasco.

ICE agents, whether deliberately or not, are misidentifying tattoos as gang related, even looking for certain clothing to single out so-called gang members and immigrants.

Here are just a few examples.

- Immigration officials have tried to identify people wearing Chicago Bulls jerseys as immigrants or gang members. Some have been detained and face deportation despite any confirmation that they are, in fact, gang members.

- Venezuelan immigrants deported to El Salvador were given no due process. And even though they were deemed criminals and gang members from the onset without the chance to prove otherwise, the government has used non-gang affiliated tattoos as evidence for their detainment and deportation.

- An actual tattoo *artist* from Venezuela, who entered the U.S. legally mind you, was deported because his tattoos were misidentified. 

- A *teenager* from Dallas was deported after immigration officials labeled his tattoo as gang related, even though he is not associated with a gang, and neither was his tattoo. He only elected to get the tattoo because he thought it ""looked cool.""

- An LGBTQ asylum seeker was also detained and deported because immigration officials misidentified his tattoos as gang related. The tattoos had no gang affiliations.

- The ACLU obtained a list from ICE of tattoos and clothing that immigration officers have been using to falsely identify gang members. The list includes tattoos that are *not* gang related, but were still used as grounds for deportation.

- Friends, family and even legal representatives have provided sworn declarations that state how many of these targeted and deported individuals have no ties to gangs and have been falsely identified based on their tattoos.

There are also many more examples of The Trump administration detaining or deporting immigrants who are in the U.S *legally*. So much for only going after the ""criminals.""

These cases include—but are not limited to—visa holders, green card holders, immigrants married to U.S. citizens, immigrants who have lived in the U.S for decades and foreign students.

And yes, there are several cases where U.S. citizens have been wrongfully detained under the Trump administration. Some cases include native Americans, one case even involved a Trump supporter, and another included that ten year old girl with brain cancer who was detained and eventually deported with her undocumented family members despite her citizenship.

For a lot of these people, the trauma doesn't stop and end with their detainment or deportation.

Many of them are deported to dangerous conditions, violent prisons, or unstable countries with high rates of crime and violence. Many are separated from their families, some have even lost their legal status, their rights, their access to the asylum seeking process, and/or their access to all other avenues for staying in the U.S. 

Not to mention that while these people are detained, they're often held in detention centers that lack basic medical care, legal support and amenities...

And on top of all of this, those wrongfully identified as gang members face discrimination and stigma, and perhaps for the rest of their lives.

So yah, ""mistake"" doesn't even begin to describe what's happening. Even if you don't sympathize with these people for whatever reason, you can at least acknowledge the exorbitant cost of this operation, the logistical nightmare it's come to be, and the damage it's doing to communities and the national economy.

Don't forget that immigrants add trillions of dollars to our GDP and work in sectors that are crucial to a functioning economy. Labor shortages in these sectors will lead to harmful consequences for the economy, which will only be exacerbated by Trump's disastrous trade and tariff policies.",3057,2025-04-01 04:41:10,2025-04-01 04:48:34,0.9

Politics,top,Newsom blasts ‘spineless’ ABC for pulling Jimmy Kimmel over Charlie Kirk remarks,,56806,52829,3977,"Compendium of notable Charlie Kirk statements:

* At a Turning Point USA event in 2023, Kirk argued, “We must also be real. We must be honest with the population. Having an armed citizenry comes with a price, and that is part of liberty... But I think it’s worth it. I think it’s worth to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year, so that we can have the Second Amendment.”
* On his radio show, Kirk dismissed empathy as a harmful idea. “I can’t stand the word empathy, actually. I think empathy is a made-up, new age term that does a lot of damage.”
* During a heated exchange on Jubilee’s Surrounded, he claimed Black people were “better” in the 1940s. “They were actually better in the 1940s. It was bad. It was evil. But what happened? Something changed. They committed less crimes… Black America is worse than it has been in the last 80 years.”
* On child pregnancy after rape? When asked how he would advise his daughter in a disturbing scenario, he said, “The answer is yes. The baby would be delivered.”
* At a TPUSA event, he compared trans identity to blackface. “A man who calls himself trans is wearing ‘woman face,’ no different than I would wear Black face trying to be a Black person. It’s assuming an identity that isn’t yours.”
* On his radio show, he claimed Joy Reid, Michelle Obama, Sheila Jackson Lee, and Ketanji Brown Jackson were “affirmative action picks” and went further, “Black women do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously. You had to go steal a white person’s slot to go be taken somewhat seriously.”
* After Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s engagement, he fantasized about her becoming more conservative. “Submit to your husband, Taylor. You’re not in charge.”
* On X, once commented, “Gun control, like vaccines and masks, is focused on making people feel ‘safe’ by taking freedoms away from others. Don’t fall for it.”
* Kirk often railed against retirement. “For future retirees, people under the age of 45, we should absolutely raise the retirement age. I’m not a fan of retirement. I don’t think retirement is biblical… I think, what a waste of the gifts that God has given you.”",1465,2025-09-18 01:24:41,2025-09-18 01:40:11,0.70

Politics,top,Sanders: Democratic Party ‘has abandoned working class people’,,56396,49064,7332,"This is a recurring historical trend. Right wing socioeconomic policies (laissez-faire capitalism) lead to social dysfunction as more and more people either fall into poverty or fear doing so. The mainstream right can't win elections on these policies any more because they have become unpopular, but rather than change those it either allies or becomes the extremist right (authoritarian and reactionary), going all in on distractions and scapegoating.

This leaves the social liberals (pro-capitalist but not socially conservative) and the social democrats as the only democratic factions to counter them, but the former block most major re-distributive policies and even the most moderate moves towards a fairer society have to be fought over tooth and nail. This alliance (either as intra-party in a two party or as a coalition in multiparty systems) then fails to do enough to keep their voters on board, disillusionment sets in, voters stay home and the extremist right takes over.

Fortunately, it doesn't always completely run through this cycle, but it keeps happening. It has now happened to the USA and the best case scenario is that when those lukewarm Trump supporters are angry at not getting what they wanted out of this ""change"" (and they won't), they will still have the means to vote the government out. If not, then you're stuck until a revolution happens.

Arguing that more social democracy would have scared away voters is sort of pointless IMHO, because if that is true then you're doomed anyway. Unless you lower economic inequality through government policy, a descent into reactionary authoritarianism is inevitable because democracy can only work when people are more or less equal and capitalism left to itself will always concentrate wealth and power into ever fewer hands.",6915,2024-11-06 22:06:42,2024-11-06 22:27:25,0.9

In Minnesota we are the Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party. It's time to reconnect with  farmers, ranchers, and blue-collar workers who don't belong to a union whose livelihoods depend on policy just the same. 

Across the U.S., there are countless small towns with populations of 300, 500, or 1500 people—places often left out of the conversation. Life in these communities is nothing like the metro centers; it’s a different pace, with unique challenges and values. When policies are shaped solely around the needs of large urban areas, it not only alienates those in rural America but sows a sense frustration and neglect. 

It’s time the party prioritizes listening to these communities and creates policies that work for everyone.  These rural voters also have another added benefit. They *always* show up in November.",708,2024-11-06 22:06:42,2024-11-06 22:53:58,0.5

I mean, they had spent well over a decade calling him a war criminal.",32,2024-11-07 17:06:29,2024-11-07 17:15:09,-0.3
Politics,controversial,Muslim Americans Say Kamala Harris Embracing Liz Cheney Cost Her Election,,0,0,0,"Liz Cheney is hardly a hero. She comes from a very dangerous clan.

That said Liz was hardly the reason too. It was probably overall resentment over the Biden administration's policy on the Israel war",67,2024-11-07 17:06:29,2024-11-07 17:07:18,-0.4

Politics,controversial,Muslim Americans Say Kamala Harris Embracing Liz Cheney Cost Her Election,,0,0,0,"Price of eggs and milk cost the election.

People who stayed home because of Cheney or Gaza are just as intransigent as the people who can’t get past the fact the prices don’t go down when you stabilize inflation.

If people think Kamala coming out harder for Gaza would have won her the swing states they are delusional. 

Progressive voters who stayed home are not worth courting because are dogmatic and don’t vote with a coalition. If they can’t see the existential threat Trump poses to progressive values they are part of the the problem. 

The dems need a coalition that wins back working class and blue collar voters, particular men. That means a focus on economic issues in a way that people understand and it means addressing the border in a comprehensive way. 

Liz Cheney, Gaza, they weren’t moving that needle. Particularly in swing states. ",17,2024-11-07 17:06:29,2024-11-07 17:13:33,-0.4
