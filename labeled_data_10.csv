Conservative,controversial,New Yorkers celebrate assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO with shooter look-a-like contest,"https://nypost.com/2024/12/07/us-news/new-yorkers-celebrate-assassination-of-unitedhealthcare-ceo-with-shooter-look-a-like-contest/

This is disgusting. They celebrated the attempted assassination of Trump. The celebrate the murder of babies. Now they celebrate the killing of a man they don't like. What the hell is wrong with these people? ",0,0,0,"I get that people are upset about the state of U.S. healthcare. They have every right to be. But every time the Democrats have held power, *they did nothing to fix the problem*... precisely because their side kowtows to the corporate interests that they're suddenly so enraged over.

Just heard today about the death of Bob Bryar, former drummer of My Chemical Romance. The band had to shut down comments (don't know which forum) because so many fans were glad he was dead... because he made the mistake of posting some conservative-leaning comments in the past.

Top that all off with two attempts on Trump, and the way they raise abortion to the level of a sacrament, and yeah, it's basically a ghoulish death cult. I always figured this is why they're so adamant about gun control -- it's because they don't think they could exercise self-control if armed and angry, so they assume everyone else must be the same.",8,2024-12-07 23:36:46,2024-12-08 05:51:33,-0.9

Conservative,controversial,AG Pam Bondi Absolutely Cooked Senate Dems...and Even Lib Reporters Couldn't Deny It,,17,8,9,"It’s funny how differently the same Senate hearing is being reported by different media outlets. Both sides are claiming each side “owned” or “cooked” the other. This article by Townhall compared to the one by the New Republic I read on r/politics demonstrates how biased reporting can be towards either side.

Townhall celebrated Bondi for staying on point and not letting the Senate Dems distract from her objective. The New Republic celebrated how Bondi ignored questions Adam Schiff asked her about the DOJ being weaponized. It’s all about perspective as to who you think “won”. It does make people skeptical about journalism overall though.

Conservative,controversial,The Atlantic's Signal Story Is Quickly Falling Apart,,176,96,80,"The article didn't play with full honesty as well.

The article claimed that Signal is an approved app. That's wrong. DOD stated that [Signal is not approved by the DoD](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/what-is-signal-messaging-encryption/story?id=120129513) as an authorized electronic messaging system. This means that Signal isn't an approved app. A Department of Defense document [stated](https://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/Library/Memo-UseOfUnclassMobileApps.pdf) that DoD personnel will not use non-DoD accounts or personal e-mail accounts, messaging systems, or other non-public DoD information systems, except approved or authorized government contractor systems, to conduct official business. As Signal is not a proven app and the messages in the chain are official businesses (they are talking about an official state action), Hegseth and others are making a mistake.

Older articles also confirmed that the use of Signal is against [DOD regulations](https://www.audacy.com/connectingvets/news/soldiers-use-signal-against-dod-regulations). A 2021 article stated that the use of the app is against [Pentagon policy](https://www.nextgov.com/digital-government/2021/06/defense-digital-service-director-used-signal-violation-pentagon-policy-ig-says/174879/). Even it is forbidden to be used by [state of Michigan](https://statescoop.com/michigan-ban-encrypted-messaging/), [Kentucky](https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/investigations/2024/10/10/louisville-police-potential-open-records-violation-with-signal-app/75554683007/), and [Las Vegas.](https://www.ktnv.com/news/crime/its-against-our-policy-metro-sheriff-speaks-on-officers-use-of-disappearing-messages-app) There's no way DOD regulations would be laxer than the regulations of states or local police force.

The article also claimed that the information is unclassified. This is wrong on so many levels. Imagine if we are at war with China and China discovered that the US is going to attack them soon. Imagine if China sees what ordinance will be used on the targets. And weather reports are not innocent as well - that means that we are going to do it. Imagine if our adversary were China - such information is far from ""unclassified"". We are fighting against Houthis, who can't do much if they have this information. If we are fighting China/Russia and they knew the targets and the ordinance - they can work out where we might be flying - and that would be very dangerous.

The statement that nothing harmful was disclosed is just these people are closing ranks, nothing more. Nothing is harmful because our adversaries are the Houthis, who didn't have any technical means to counter our airstrikes. If the same conduct is done against others, it would be very harmful.",90,2025-03-25 20:17:38,2025-03-26 03:05:14,-0.8

They will jump at any chance to belittle someone especially online because they perceive they are safe. This is a common behavior of people with very low self esteem and/or very little maturity. Charlie drove this part of the left especially crazy because he would drive the discussion with genuine love and belief in service to God. I think many on the left are happy he’s gone but what he left behind is very powerful because he lived his life as Jesus commanded.

Company looks good because of “external reason” and they save their money, win win for them.

Republican,top,Thinking about leaving the left. Nervous.,"Hi everyone! I hope its okay for me to post here since I am actually not a republican. I have been a leftist for about 8 years now but I have been shifting further to the right without realizing it. Issues like abortion, and trans rights have been big ones for me that I have disagreed with the far left and have moved further right on. 

Recently though I have become disenfranchised with the left in general, and the catalyst for that was the Charlie Kirk assassination. Prior to his death I REALLY disliked Charlie. I hated what ""I thought"" he stood for, but after he died i was appalled by the reaction of the left. I think people actually celebrating was a small percentage of the left, but the general opinion from basically everyone i know on the left was AT BEST ""I don't condone violence but he had it coming"". No he didn't. That's ridiculous. What happened is horrifying for him and his family. 

Well then after his death as I looked more into Charlie with an open mind I found out he actually isn't a piece of garbage. I still disagree with a much of what he says, but I agree with A LOT more than I thought, and even when I dont agree I think he is a well meaning good person. 

This whole thing had forced me to face what I believe. I have already independently been going on a faith transition as well. I left the mormon church when I joined the left and now I am starting to become open to mainstream Christianity. The transitions in my beliefs felt like they weren't connected as they were happening but I think that probably isn't the case anymore. 

Anyway, that brings me to posting here. I am kinda nervous about this and wishing my views weren't changing. I felt a lot of judgement leaving my church and leaving the right, but when I think about leabing the left i worry about facing a lot more judgement. If I actually became a conservative I feel like I would be a closeted conservative. I dunno. I just wanted people on the right to talk to about this as I figure it out.

I have had the same positions pretty much and they just reveal more of their venom and malevolence when you give them a chance. I was part of NYPIRG (very progressive) and was elected to student gov't at my college and saw that my dem leaning party was just so vile and wicked (tearing down other parties' signs and ripping them up) etc. Dems just have a utilitarian (the end justifies the means) mindset that I don't agree with. If you read your history books, history is replete with the collectivist left straight up murdering citizenry (Cultural Revolution, etc.)

When I became a citizen, I was told 'you can't vote in this town if you don't register as a Democrat.' I was so caught up in the moment I actually believed the guy.

Apparently, it's also perfectly fine being anti-male or anti-Asian. Boggles the mind why they can't understand why they're losing all the male votes and why Dems lost 2M registered voters to Republicans over the last 4 years. They literally spent $20M to find out why men are leaving their party. I'd be surprised if the stampede out of the Dem party doesn't accelerate as they reveal more of their wickedness.

Republican,top,Thinking about leaving the left. Nervous.,"Hi everyone! I hope its okay for me to post here since I am actually not a republican. I have been a leftist for about 8 years now but I have been shifting further to the right without realizing it. Issues like abortion, and trans rights have been big ones for me that I have disagreed with the far left and have moved further right on. 

Recently though I have become disenfranchised with the left in general, and the catalyst for that was the Charlie Kirk assassination. Prior to his death I REALLY disliked Charlie. I hated what ""I thought"" he stood for, but after he died i was appalled by the reaction of the left. I think people actually celebrating was a small percentage of the left, but the general opinion from basically everyone i know on the left was AT BEST ""I don't condone violence but he had it coming"". No he didn't. That's ridiculous. What happened is horrifying for him and his family. 

Well then after his death as I looked more into Charlie with an open mind I found out he actually isn't a piece of garbage. I still disagree with a much of what he says, but I agree with A LOT more than I thought, and even when I dont agree I think he is a well meaning good person. 

This whole thing had forced me to face what I believe. I have already independently been going on a faith transition as well. I left the mormon church when I joined the left and now I am starting to become open to mainstream Christianity. The transitions in my beliefs felt like they weren't connected as they were happening but I think that probably isn't the case anymore. 

Anyway, that brings me to posting here. I am kinda nervous about this and wishing my views weren't changing. I felt a lot of judgement leaving my church and leaving the right, but when I think about leabing the left i worry about facing a lot more judgement. If I actually became a conservative I feel like I would be a closeted conservative. I dunno. I just wanted people on the right to talk to about this as I figure it out. Also if any of you are based in Utah I would like to meet young adult conservatives (ideally non mormon).",1277,1059,218,"I'd be nervous too, considering their answer to disagreements is increasingly violence. They're the ones assaulting people wearing hats they don't like, assaulting police/ICE conducting operations, vandalizing Teslas and dealerships because they don't like the owner and most egregious of all, threatening and killing people who dare to talk to college students on campuses. And they think all of this is normal and perfectly justified, based on a 30 second Google search they conduct which returns distorted quotes taken out of context, which validate their extreme, twisted positions. It's out of control.

Compared to that, we're the very definition of sensible and sane. It sounds like your religious journey is evolving, and I think you'll be welcomed into many churches that are more aligned with your evolved beliefs.   
  
So welcome and hope you feel more accepted and at peace with conservative folks, as well as our viewpoints which we think are reasonable and rationale.",35,2025-09-23 15:27:26,2025-09-23 17:23:07,-0.9

I am a registered Republican, but I don't consider myself  a Conservative.  There are some topics that I lean more center-left on and some that I lean right on.  For example abortion.  For me, I do not think abortion should be used as a form of ""birth control"".  If you are engaging in the act, willingly, then you should know and accept that there are consequences to everything. An unplanned pregnancy is a consequence of being sexually active. However, I do support pregnancy termination if the mother's life is in danger or if the baby has perished or has a severe medical abnormality (brain or heart not developed). I also think it is understandable how a victim of SA would not want to carry a baby.  I know you also mentioned issues surrounding transgender individuals.  I am center-left leaning on this too.  I support any adult who makes the decision to transition.  That is their choice and I have no right to judge them.  But, I do not support children transitioning.  There are a bunch of reasons I could list, but this would be a huge post.  I am in agreement with banning transgender athletes.  Both men's and women's sports.  
Generally speaking I support decisions that benefit the country as a whole.  The economy, national security....these outweigh most of my concerns.",27,2025-09-23 15:27:26,2025-09-23 17:24:33,-0.5

I also am finding that my opinion of conservatives has gotten a lot better and I agree with conservatives on a lot more than I used to. I think the biggest thing I want right now is just a space to talk about this journey because I dont feel like I have that.

I WOULD like to see the homeless problem addressed in our major cities in California, as a lot of crime pops up in and around the immediate area by homeless encampments. I think our leaders are failing us here as the average citizen shouldn’t be asked to deal with these strung-out, hostile individuals on a daily basis. I don’t deal with with gun violence cities like Chicago and New Orleans deal with so I can’t speak on that. 

My problem with the president sending in troops is it seems to be all aesthetics. The illusion that he’s being tough on crime. None of it is addressing the systemic root problems that cause crime. Sure, crime might go down temporarily while troops are present, but we all can agree this can’t be a long term solution. The cost is enormous and even the national guard troops have said there are better things they could be doing. So as soon as they leave, we can anticipate crime climbing right back up to where it was before they came. So what is really the point of any of this? So that the president can stick it to lib cities and MAGA can high five each other for a little while? As a city dweller, I actually want solutions that work.

I’m gonna ask you - if you’re voting for a candidate who didn’t even have a primary election because you have a gay or transgender friend of family member, and you “care about their interests,” as a gay man diagnosed with gender dysphoria here are my interests:

- An end to funding wars

- The protection of children from a billion dollar industry that wants to mutilate their bodies before they turn 18
- The protection of femboys and Tom boys who would grow up in any other age to just be gay or gender non conforming
- The right to 100% free speech - freedom of speech IS freedom from consequences from the government 
- The right to have the first female  president win because she is better than any man in power - not because she is a DEI
- The protection of women from men invading their spaces
- The protection from the state forcing a sh0t onto me
- The protection of my religion (Christianity) from an atheist death cult 
- The protection of illégal migrant children and innocent refugees (make them citizens, not slaves)
- The continued criminalization of mind altering drugs 
- The protection from sterilizing children who aren’t trusted to drink or vote or get a tattoo, but for some reason can destroy their bodies

It was common sense, it was the country in dire need of strong leadership, it was the idea of how we as a country can longer stand the divide.

I remember when I was still Democrat in 2016 I voted Hilary, I know, I know…. Anyway I said that to a coworker who’s a Military Vet who was also for Trump, and you know what he did?

I’ve never asked anyone their political views, religious views, or ideological views. I could care less, I’m mainly looking at cash flow and collateral.

Auditors are always checking files and looking over everything.

Financial institutions make money off loans, commercial loans have the best margins. I’m guessing cash flow issues, or collateral issues, or slow pay history could be involved with those stories. But, you never hear the full story on why. 

This also only applies to huge banks of $10billion in assets, so if you don’t bank with a national bank, this will likely change nothing for most. 

At the $10 billion mark a whole lot more regulations are applied to a financial institution in general.",49,2025-03-03 17:04:23,2025-03-03 18:46:19,0

Republican,controversial,BREAKING: President Trump Signs One Big Beautiful Bill Into Law – MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 🇺🇸🦅,,0,0,0,"EDIT UPDATE: The thread is locked because we were brigaded. Fortunately reddit's crowd control feature removed like 90% of the brigaders' comments before anyone saw them. The sub that started the brigade has been notified, hopefully they do they right thing (though it feels nice to be famous over there). Every brigader has been reported to reddit admin. END UPDATE

With the amount of conservatives talking about this bill as if it is a loss that I'm seeing, and not just that, but acting like it is almost the worst thing that could happen, I'm laying down a strict rule here.

We do not care if you have negative views of this bill, that is fine. But if I see you talking with the same bitchy and pathetic language I am seeing so many conservatives speak right now that act as if this ISN'T a win, then I will ban you.

It is a win. We needed a spending bill, it has more spending than ANY of us would like, but if you think you can just do a U-ey driving the biggest economy the world has ever seen, then you are insane. Stop acting like we could have passed a bill that cancelled all spending and reduced the deficit to 0. That is how so many are acting. It is irrational and it is based on fallacious thinking (irrational thinking that requires the use of logical fallacies).

You will be banned for rule 7.

**If you must criticize the bill, do so with substance, do so with context, do so with the understanding that if Kamala won, then we'd have run headfirst into the fucking wall already. Do NOT just post a little stupid zinger comment like "":("" or "" why are people excited about this?"" Be adults, be people who can make points. Stop being internet bitches. Make arguments not pathetic snipes.**

Be men. For fuck's sake, be men.

If all you can do is downvote instead of making an articulate and respectful critique, then you should get off the fucking internet or go spend your brain power jerking off, because that is about as much as you're adding to the conversation.

1. The Inuit were the first humans to inhabit Greenland.  How does that make them not indigenous?  Though I'm not sure what any of this has to do with the argument to buy the territory.  

2. What an ignorant thing to say.  There is no minimum population to be a sovereign country. Vatican City has under 1,000 permanent residents; Tuvalu has about 11,000 people; there are many other countries with fewer than 60,000 residents.  How is the geography of the land relevant to whether or not it's a sovereign country?

3. What evidence do you have that Denmark is ""not capable of stopping"" them?  China has gotten its hands on US farmland, US port operators, some US companies...apparently we are not capable of stopping them either.  

4. 5. Natural resources are not widely extracted in Greenland because most of the residents oppose it, not due to a lack of ability.  That wouldn't change just by virtue of the territory joining the US. In fact it would then bring out all the usual suspects here with lawsuits slowing down or blocking the activities.  

6. LMAO you seriously think Greenlanders are desperate for a ""better life""?  They are Danish and therefore EU citizens, meaning they have the right to travel, live, and work throughout the EU.  Greenland is part of most of the intra-EU market rules. Greenland gets Danish assistance and European Union economic development assistance.  They receive Denmark's socialized medicine and other generous social welfare benefits.  Do you really think they want to give all that up to be part of a brand new country, culture, economic system, private medical/insurance system, and a drastically less generous social welfare system?",28,2025-01-17 20:04:06,2025-01-18 02:36:51,0.5

There are plenty of countries with populations less than Greenland. I do agree that 60,000 people with all that land should not constitute a sovereign country. 

USA can have a strong presence in Greenland without owning. 

The idea that if you can't devolp your resources that means you shouldn't have them is flawed. 

By that logic, colonialism is always right. Every high income western country should own some poor African country to “develop” their resources.

Republican,controversial,Why is Trump doing tariffs?,"This perspective contains some important truths.
You don't have to agree with me completely, but I feel it's essential to clarify these points, and I hope you'll share them with others for better understanding.
The primary goal of the tariffs on Chinese goods—coupled with tariffs on imports from other countries—is to stabilize the American economy while applying pressure on China. Given that China relies heavily on exports to the United States, our economy represents a critical source of revenue for them. A downturn in trade with the U.S. would undoubtedly harm their economy, especially since many other countries cannot absorb the volume of goods that China exports to the U.S.
Additionally, the efforts to restrict Chinese companies like TikTok stem from concerns about their financial ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). There's a belief that these companies receive significant support from the CCP to sway American public opinion.
Moreover, many Chinese apps are perceived to pose a risk to U.S. citizens' data privacy. Other sectors, such as steel and oil, also have strategic connections to the CCP, raising concerns about their influence in the American market. The fear is that these companies could withdraw from the U.S. market entirely, leaving America vulnerable.
When Trump proposed banning TikTok, it wasn't a spur-of-the-moment decision designed to provoke people. It was a strategic move intended to safeguard American data from potential exploitation by China.
The broader aim is to reduce the presence of Chinese companies in the U.S. and encourage domestic production, ensuring that the United States can operate independently and limit the CCP’s influence over American citizens and businesses.

There's one part I’m still unclear about, though: If the purpose of tariffs is stabilizing the economy and reducing national debt, wouldn't it make more sense to hold off on cutting taxes, especially for wealthy individuals like Musk?

Otherwise, aren't we just offsetting any benefit from tariffs by immediately reducing revenue, leaving us stuck with the same financial pressures and higher costs?",60,2025-04-15 03:18:32,2025-04-15 03:38:15,0.5

It’s near comical when I read people’s opinions, that are so diehard to go fight Russia head on yet even the Europeans are very reserved on such an action. I wonder why? As if it wasn’t obvious enough… 🤔

Republican,controversial,Don’t forget: Trump is not the first U.S. president to lash out at Zelenskyy for being ungrateful,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna54592,48,26,22,"> While Trump berated Zelensky in front of a worldwide television audience, he’s not the first president to get into a spat with Zelensky as his predecessor had a similar exchange with the Ukrainian leader, however under far different circumstances and in a much more private setting.

> NBC News exclusively reported in 2022 that Biden lost his temper on a phone with Zelensky soon after Russia’s invasion. According to NBC News Biden had called the besieged leader to tell him that he had just greenlit another $1 billion in aid to Ukraine. Before Biden could reportedly even finish his sentence Zelensky began firing off a list of additional help he needed and wasn’t getting at the time. Biden reportedly quickly lost his temper, sources familiar with the call told NBC News.

> Biden administration officials told the outlet that Biden and Zelensky’s relationship only improved since that June 2022 phone and never rose beyond Biden losing his temper.

Republican,controversial,Don’t forget: Trump is not the first U.S. president to lash out at Zelenskyy for being ungrateful,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna54592,48,26,22,"Obama did nothing whatsoever when Russia took the Crimea, Biden gave Ukraine enough support to keep fighting, not enough to win, and now Trump is ending a war effort which wasn't in the interest of the Ukranians as it was just a long, bloody and incredibly destructive defeat. Biden's administration used Ukraine to bleed Russia, there was never any serious attempt at ensuring Ukraine could win. Ukraine has no reason to be grateful to us. 

Russia has always been seen by Americans as the enemy, but that's not how Trump sees things. We are currently shifting support away from our traditional allies, so it's not astonishing we are getting closer to Russia. They are an oligarchy, something the US has been moving towards with the growing power of our tech giants. We saw the power of tech leaders behind Trump when he was elected, and Elon Musk's review of government finances underlines it. By electing Trump, we chose American power and economic succeess over traditional democracy. Friendship with Russia is a natural extension of that. 

Russia will be able to slowly expand its power and influence in Europe because European powers have not bothered to maintain an effective defence force, but have expected the US to provide their protection for free.",15,2025-02-28 22:58:53,2025-03-01 09:44:06,-0.8

And sure as hell I read that for the past 10+ years the Chinese are the number one foreign student population.

In summary, the statement “Shocking government report reveals national debt crisis grew much worse under Biden” is an exaggerated portrayal of the facts. The underlying government report (primarily the CBO’s budget outlook) does reveal that the national debt is at a record high and on an unsustainable path​[crfb.org](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/cbo-releases-january-2025-budget-and-economic-outlook#:~:text=CBO%20Releases%20January%202025%20Budget,or%20118%20percent%20of%20GDP)​[gao.gov](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-25-107714.pdf#:~:text=%5BPDF%5D%20GAO,than%20the%20economy%20each). It also shows that recent years’ policies – including those under Biden – have added substantially to the debt. However, the report itself is not “shocking” in tone and does not explicitly pin the worsening debt solely on President Biden. The “crisis grew much worse under Biden” phrasing comes from political commentary, not a neutral government conclusion.",1,2025-02-19 14:46:29,2025-02-19 20:48:12,0

Social media is a huge recruiting and retention tool. Social media has been a way for soldiers to circumvent toxic CoCs and solve issues with all sorts of issues within the military. Social media has expanded the reach of our recruiting element, and develop a public face for the military. 


The military isn’t just some grunt with a rifle, there is a whole lot more involved. Logistics, Medical, Intelligence, Signal, Adjutant General, etc.. Space billets, instructor billets, public affairs billets. There is so much more than shooting at bad guys with guns to building an effective military 


I have the same opinion with the bands. That role has been in the US Army since 1775. Bands provide drill and ceremony. Bands build morale. That is an important component to the services.

Republican,controversial,Media Fail — Trump Job Approval Rises 4 Points to 53%,,122,71,51,"""Once, strength was swinging the heaviest sword the fastest. It was muscle, grit, stamina—the stuff of warriors and conquerors. That was America. But we didn’t evolve. We clung to our gladiator games, our football fields, and called it pride. Meanwhile, other nations shifted. They trained minds, not just bodies. They built labs while we built stadiums. Now we’re staring down the future with yesterday’s definition of strength—and we’re losing. Not in battle, but in relevance. This is how empires fall—not with a bang, but with the refusal to adapt.""

""America, we need to wake up.

Not tomorrow. Not next year. Right now.

We’ve become soft. Comfortable. Addicted to ease. We’ve traded strength for convenience, and pride for distraction. Our six-year-olds sit glued to tablets all day, swiping through videos made by creators in countries training their six-year-olds to code, to engineer, to lead. While our children are being raised on YouTube and Roblox, theirs are being raised on algorithms, robotics, and artificial intelligence.

Fifteen years ago, countries like China, South Korea, and Japan made computer science mandatory. Not optional—mandatory. By third grade, their kids were writing real code. By middle school, building software. By high school, competing in AI competitions. That first generation is now turning 20—mentally armed, strategically prepared, and ready to dominate the next world stage.

And what are we doing? We're still teaching like it's 1985. Still drilling Revolutionary War timelines into students' heads like redcoats are about to land on the beach. Our education system is stuck in a time capsule—memorizing dates and coloring in maps—while the rest of the world is training cyber soldiers, engineers, and quantum thinkers.

And sure, they say, ""We teach the past so we don’t repeat it."" But listen closely—you’re not going to repeat the past. The past was fought with muskets, cannons, bombs. The next war won’t be fought with a bullet. It won’t be dropped from a plane or fired from a ship.

It will come in silence.

It will come through code.

And when it hits, you won’t even know it happened—until it’s too late.

Here’s how fast it can all go dark:

1. No communication. Core cell networks can be taken offline by attacking protocols like SS7 or targeting telecom infrastructure with firmware-level malware. In seconds, every phone goes dead. No signal. No alerts. No way to reach help.

2. No power. Our electrical grid runs on ancient SCADA systems—exploitable, internet-connected, and dangerously under-protected. A single piece of malware—like Industroyer or Triton—can fry substations, kill the grid, and black out entire cities.

3. No news. Take out a handful of CDN providers or hijack the cloud infrastructure media depends on, and suddenly, the entire country is blind. No press. No facts. Just panic and rumor.

4. No transportation. GPS can be spoofed. Traffic lights hacked. Trains derailed digitally. Autonomous systems thrown into chaos. Airports shut down in minutes. You’re not going anywhere.

5. No water. Water treatment facilities run on connected industrial control systems. Cyber attacks can spike chemical levels—or shut the whole system off. Your tap runs dry. Your toilet doesn't flush.

6. No economy. Banks freeze. ATMs crash. Payment networks collapse. Even your crypto wallet might be worthless if DNS services are compromised. It’s not just money that disappears—it’s trust.

And if you live somewhere like North Dakota, Minnesota, or Alaska—where temperatures drop below zero? You don’t have power? You don’t have heat. And if you don’t already have a fire burning? You’re already too late.

This isn’t just theory. It’s not some “what-if” scenario. The backbone of our country—communications, defense systems, energy infrastructure—is increasingly dependent on digital systems built and managed through foreign-owned platforms. Microsoft, one of our most embedded contractors, operates major data centers across Asia—including inside China. Our military’s infrastructure, our federal systems, even our hospitals and emergency services—tied to clouds we don’t fully control.

That should terrify every American.

We’ve become the users, not the builders. The watchers, not the creators. And we are sprinting toward a future we are not prepared to defend.

We need to stop entertaining ourselves to death.

We need to get back to building. Creating. Securing. Innovating. Educating—not like it's 1985, but like it’s 2035. Code and cyber must become as important as reading and writing. AI literacy must become a standard, not an elective. Discipline and awareness must return as cultural pillars—not side effects of hardship, but choices of strength.

Because the future isn’t waiting for us.

And if we don’t act now, when it comes—it will be silent, swift, and permanent.",8,2025-04-06 18:43:18,2025-04-07 03:08:37,-0.6

They don’t engage with why Trump was popular in the first place, or the real concerns of his supporters. Instead, they just slap on these dismissive terms as a way to feel morally superior without ever having to face the complexity of the political situation.

What’s most irritating is the sheer ignorance and the confidence they have in their own misplaced certainty. They wrap themselves in intellectual snobbery, acting like they’ve got all the answers, yet their actual understanding of the issues is severely lacking. It’s one thing to be wrong, but it’s another to be arrogantly wrong and somehow convinced you’re right.

It’s not that eggs weren’t lowered on Day 1. (No one seriously thinks that how the world works). It’s that there’s no planned offered, just an empty promise. The closest thing to specifics are tariffs, which likely if anything makes prices (even of domestic goods) more expensive.  

So people are pointing back to a stated concern of voters (ie inflation) and noting there’s no plans to address the costs (let alone the underlining cause, bird flu). 

The expectation (which is foolish of course) is that people will rationally pause to reconsider. Was price increases really as important as many said? Or were the empty promises really convincing and if so, what to make from the abandonment of kitchen table issues like egg prices? 

We know it won’t matter. People won’t reconsider. There will be another set of scape goats to focus on. All the while the plunder of our great nation continues, but not for the benefit of people who have to worry about things like grocery prices.",36,2025-01-31 21:53:52,2025-02-01 01:46:35,-0.40

Republican,controversial,Did the Democrats Commit and Act of Insurrection By Trying to Force Their Way Into the Department of Education,"
Given there is a constitutional separation of Congress from the Executive branch, Congress cannot force their way into Department Buildings just like Trump can’t force his way into a congressional office and demand to speak to congressional staff. Given the Dems actions violate the constitutions separation of powers, and given it was a physical confrontation, based on the Dems definition, wasn’t that an act of insurrection… 
",124,74,50,"No, based on the available reports, the incident involving House Democrats at the Department of Education does not meet the legal definition of an insurrection.

Why?

1. Lack of Violence – The event was a peaceful confrontation between lawmakers and security personnel. There were no reports of physical altercations, property damage, or attempts to overthrow the government.


2. No Attempt to Seize Power – Insurrection involves forceful opposition to government authority or an attempt to overthrow it. The lawmakers were exercising their congressional oversight role, albeit in a confrontational manner, by seeking entry into a government building.


3. Precedent in Protests – Elected officials have historically staged protests or sit-ins to make political points. This falls within First Amendment protections rather than insurrection laws.



What About the Comparison to January 6th?

The January 6th riot was legally defined as an insurrection because:

It involved violence, breaking into the Capitol, attacking police officers, and damaging government property.

Its goal was to stop the certification of a lawful election, directly interfering with the democratic process.


By contrast, the Democrats at the Department of Education were not attempting to prevent the execution of government functions—they were objecting to an administrative decision and seeking a discussion.

Verdict:

This was a political protest, not an insurrection. Calling it one is a false equivalence based on the facts available.",351,2025-02-08 22:01:32,2025-02-08 23:18:20,0.6

Twenty-Second Amendment
Section 1

No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once. But this Article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President when this Article was proposed by the Congress, and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President, or acting as President, during the term within which this Article becomes operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during the remainder of such term.

Section 2

This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven years from the date of its submission to the States by the Congress.",21,2025-03-31 15:38:24,2025-04-01 01:43:01,0.5
