Ask_Politics,controversial,Did Trump really cause free Tuition wave in universities?,"Hey guys, so I had recently talked with a Trump supporting family member about how many universities, including but not limited to MIT, UT Austin, and CMU, all recently announced free tuition for qualifying students next school year. This is obviously a positive and beneficial change to many students, especially low-income, as it gives them a chance at higher education they might've not had before.

My Trump supporting family member however credited this to him, stating that his threat to tax university endowments is pressuring universities into using these funds, providing these opportunities, especially with his recent re-election win. I just want to know if there's any validity to this claim, and did it really contribute to the free tuition? I'd like to hear what you all have to say.

Ask_Politics,controversial,Why do people hate Christianity/Catholicism? ,"
I have a hard time understanding why so many people hate Christianity/Catholicism and I would like to genuinely know why some people do. 

I understand that the religion has caused many atrocities and been mismanaged, but simply studying history will show that it's not the only religion to do this. 

I also understand about the thought that it subjugates women but there are other religions that mutilate the genitals of women and others that force women to wear burkas. Many have even been murdered if they are caught not wearing them correctly or if they're caught outside without a man or even if they're caught learning in school. I also know about the topic of abortion but numerous religions are against it in addition to Catholicism. Some religions believe that women are nothing but a baby machine and encourage men to have multiple wives and treat their women like meat. 

It is also a fact that not only Christianity frowns upon gay marriage and some religions even murder gay people or force them to transition to the other gender so they wouldn't be considered ""gay"" anymore. 

There's also the glaring issue of molestation and rape cases in the Catholic Church but there is much evidence to suggest that the same rates can be found in nearly every religion and that there is even higher rates when it comes to schools. 

Finally the only reason I can think of for people hating this religion is due to religious trauma where people say they were kicked out and disowned by family when they didn't want to be the same religion. Also a lot of cases of religious abuse leads to this, I believe.But there are also countless stories where other religions do the same thing and in some cases, they do even worse than Catholics. 

This is not to disrespect any other religions I am just genuinely curious to know why people have such distain for Catholics/Christians. Is it because people don't know that other religions do the same things and sometimes even worse? Is it because it isn't reported as much with other religions? Even with religious abuse it seems like there is a spotlight on Christianity and the stories of abuse from other religions are thrown to the wayside.

Christianity is the dominant religion in America. Sure, we have other religions like Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, etc. and even no religion at all but in reality, none of these groups have any real power in the country. 

The American government is supposed to be neutral towards religion. It is supposed to respect and protect people's right to practice their religion but it can't promote one religion over another. 

Since about the 1980s, Evangelicals have been trying to make their religion the law of the land. If their religion says something is wrong then they want laws to exist that ban it for every single citizen. 

Religion is supposed to be personal. If you believe that it is wrong to eat pork then good for you, don't eat pork. You shouldn't push for laws that would require everyone to give up pork. 

This is why there is a lot of pushback. Most people would agree that you have a personal right to practice or not practice a religion and are fine with that. They get upset when you try to make your religion the law of the land.",4,2024-11-08 09:43:22,2024-11-08 18:12:42,0.5

Is there some sort of bias going on? ,1,0,1,"I know that since this post, it's been called, but I can go a little into how the AP (and the media at large) decides to call elections.

Just for starters, the AP doesn't ""predict"" outcomes. Many news stations have realized over the years that calling races as early as possible is good for ratings. If your station shows results earlier, people are going to want to watch your station to find out the results. This leads to stations effectively calling races when it's ""highly likely"" that a candidate wins. The AP, on the other hand, basically has zero tolerance for getting it wrong. In the 2024 primaries, the AP called around 2,500 elections. They got 2 wrong, which they later had to issue corrections for, but 1 of those errors was due to misreporting by election officials.

Describing how they actually call elections is a fairly complicated subject because it relies on statistical analysis from many sources. Simply put, the election result is called when the AP decides that it is no longer possible for the trailing candidate to win. 

For instance, you can look at voter rolls. Party registration and the most recent voting date are accessible in publicly available records. They use this and other data to determine how people are voting, either by election day voting, early voting, mail in ballots, etc. You can closely track how elections are going and if things like party registration, voter turnout, and the current count (by ballot type) are indicative that one of the candidates can no longer win the election, the race will be called.",4,2024-11-11 21:31:22,2024-11-12 14:54:47,0

Only in modern times with 24 hour news cycles was the incentive to be the first to call a race.

And they were able to create a government without any left-wing socialists and right-wing nationalists.

That's kind of a bad example [because that government just collapsed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/05/what-happens-next-now-france-government-has-fallen-explainer).  And that government was formed that way to prevent the largest party in the government from [having control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_France).  But also to your point, it was the National Rally and Socialists (and others) to take it down.  (Note: French politics is *weird*)

But to the general question - I think even the Left and MAGA have a lot in common but they are too stuck to their means to achieving those goals to realize that they're essentially striving for the same goals.

Take the tariffs that everyone is tearing their hair out about.  Trump has said, for example, that we might need a [tariff (and more)](https://apnews.com/article/us-steel-nippon-trump-biden-steelworkers-1b0fb38077ff0a6b68e64a184f270bac) on cheap, foreign sources of steel in order to protect our domestic production - and blocking the acquisition of US Steel by Nippon Steel.  The goal of this is to strength the domestic steel industry, which is very unionized and in traditional ""blue"" areas.  If they'd stop reflexively opposing *everything* Trump says, we'd be better off.

And that said, the same is true with MAGA and Biden/the Left.  The utter insistence that the only stimulus that should be given is their version and basically bailing on any negotiation *has* to stop.  It leads to *horrible* situations and is basically just making the Presidency stronger - which is going to be to their benefit soon, but eventually the other party gets control!

We need a party that represents the working class. Sadly, we no longer have that.",42,34,8,"A few things.

1. The super PAC point is moot in presidential elections.  Trump has been very outspent in every election he’s been in, and it doesn’t seem to make much difference.  Corporate-interest donors are a thing, but they’re not nearly as relevant as you think.  There’s a *ton* of billionaire donors who clearly aren’t in it for profit, and if anything just happen to be ideologues who have a ton of money.  And there’s plenty of billionaires who fund progressives (Steyer, Bloomberg, Soros).  There’s also very limited evidence that Super PAC money is relevant.  The campaigns that rely on Super PAC’s instead of their own campaigns (where donations are capped) tend to do very poorly.  There’s just so much small-dollar money in politics right now on both the left and right that getting a giant influx of Super PAC money isn’t actually a big difference-maker.

2. You’re obviously correct that Democrats have lost non-college working class people, but I think your analysis is off.  From a *policy* perspective, the Democratic Party’s leadership is more progressive than ever.  Obama governed to Clinton’s left economically.  Hillary Clinton ran on an economic agenda to Obama’s left.  Biden governed in a much more progressive way than Obama, and moreso than Hillary proposed. Biden catered to unions in ways no Democrat had done, pushed climate-related spending no Democrat had ever proposed.  The Build Back Better bill went way further than anything that any other Democratic president would have done.  But it was Bill Clinton who put up the best numbers with working class voters, by a mile. He was more *moderate* than the previous two Democratic nominees (Dukakis and Mondale), but did way better among non-college voters.  Today, non-college voters disassociate from Democrats not because of their policy proposals, but because of a feeling that the party is not interested in them *despite* those policies.  Democrats are the party of progressive activist groups, who are quite out of touch with actual working class people.  Their rhetoric is alienating.  The vibes are all wrong.  Their priorities seem pointless.   Proposing yet another massive transfer of wealth, or a bigger welfare state, does not solve this.  Democrats need to stand up to the unpopular elements of their own coalition.",8,2024-11-12 21:54:34,2024-11-14 02:03:04,0.6

* Polling methods have improved since 2016 (and because of it).
* Hillary was a poor choice. Of the 20 candidates fielded by the major parties in the 2016 primaries (17 Republican, 3 Democratic), the nominees ended up being the two with the *lowest* net approval ratings. Harris' net approval is higher than Hillary's was.
* Trump was an unknown quantity in 2016. Once he was known, he lost in 2020.
* Hillary ran a poor campaign. Given the shortened timeframe, Harris has run a much better campaign. 
* Trump's 2016 victory was marked by a lot of new Republican voter registration. People registered for the first time just to vote for him. Although this statistic isn't frequently cited, it's especially important, because people who take the time to register in a given cycle have a higher propensity to vote. New [Democratic voter registration has outpaced the Republicans](https://pentagroup.com/insight/state-snapshot-the-surge-in-newly-registered-voters) in the key swing states that will decide the election this year.
* [Early voting in the three ""blue wall"" states](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-elections/early-vote) favors registered Democrats. If Harris wins those states, she's highly likely to win the election.

1) Black populations in the state, this is ironically a legacy of slavery, Virginia was a slave state a lot of black slaves were brought to Virginia, this lead to relatively large black populations in the state around 18%, meanwhile West Virginia has only 3% black population, black people vote predominantly Democrat.

(demographics taken from world population review) 

2) Urbanisation levels, this might be the largest one, West Virginia has effectively only one relatively large town and that is Charleston-Huntington metro area. And even that is relatively small, this leads to rest of the populace being in small towns or rural areas. Meanwhile Virginia has of course NoVa (Northern Virginia is the most talked about) with cities like Arlington and Alexandria. But let's not forget about Norfolk metro area, with cities like Virginia Beach and Newport News. And then the capital Richmond itself. Virginia has quite large metro areas. Summarised Virginia has 77,6% urbanisation rate, meanwhile West Virginia has 44,6% urbanisation rate.

(urban rate brought from Wikipedia)

3) Education and end of Coal mining industry in West Virginia, West Virginia was historically a coal mining state, you don't need particularly educated workforce for that. And since the Democrats controlled the state since the coal industry collapsed there was a massive swing to the Republicans, West Virginia feels betrayed by Democrats, only around 13% of West Virginians have a college degree. Meanwhile Virginia has NoVa, NoVa is important state wide for being a service economy hub and important for federal administration, you need high education for these jobs, that's why Virginia has almost twice as large College degree graduation lying at around 25%. This again moves it to vote more Democratic.

(information from Statista)

Some quotes:

**American voters are less ideologically polarized than they think they are, and that misperception is greatest for the most politically engaged people**. 

However, most partisans hold major misbeliefs about the other party’s preferences that lead them to think there is far less shared policy belief. This perception gap is highest among progressive activists, followed closely by extreme conservatives: in other words, the people who are most involved in civic and political life hold the least accurate views of the other side’s beliefs. Figure 1 shows the gap between what groups of Americans think the other side believes and what they self-report believing, as of 2019.

**American politicians are highly ideologically polarized. In other words, they believe in and vote for different sets of policies, with little overlap. This trend has grown in a steady, unpunctuated manner for decades.** 

One reason that the most highly politically engaged Americans may misunderstand the other side is that they correctly estimate the extreme ideological polarization among politicians. 

While at this point, candidates and parties may be responding to polarized primary voters, candidates and parties have been driving the polarization, and not all voters are ideologically polarized. 

The disparity between where leaders are ideologically and where their voters are precludes legislative policy agreement on many issues. Average voters are not able to assert their (often weak) policy preferences because they do not have an effective way to vote out representatives who do not accurately represent their constituents’ views, particularly on the right where party chairs are likely to substitute one extreme candidate for another.

**Even though Americans are not as ideologically polarized as they believe themselves to be, they** ***are*** **emotionally polarized (known as “affective polarization”). In other words, they do not like members of the other party.** 

Americans harbor strong dislike for members of the other party (though they also dislike their own parties, as well). While social media is often blamed for this phenomenon, affective polarization started growing before the internet: its onset more closely correlates with the rise of cable news and radio talk shows.

**Similarly, affective polarization is not causing political violence directly. It is probably contributing to an environment that allows politicians and opinion leaders to increase violence targeted at politicians, election officials, women, and many types of minorities.** 

Affective polarization in the United States has been rising for decades, while political violence only increased sharply in 2016. Affective polarization is also quite symmetrical across parties, while political violence is overwhelmingly from the right. This suggests that emotional feelings of hatred toward members of the other party are not a primary cause of political violence. ",15,2025-01-05 06:03:44,2025-01-05 22:47:14,0

There the vote for president would be between the state caucuses, so 50 potential votes, of which a candidate would need 26 to win.

The way the votes would be tallied is by state caucuses voting within themselves and then the winning candidate would be given that states vote. So for example all of Californias representatives in the house would vote among themselves, and whichever candidate won would receive the vote of California.

The same would go for every state.

These votes would go on until a single candidate got at least 26 states votes.

Here is the clause in the constitution article 2 clause 2 “…  The electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by ballot for two persons, of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same State with themselves. And they shall make a list of an the persons voted for, and of the number of votes for each; which list they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States, directed to the president of the Senate. The president of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates, and the votes shall then be counted. The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed; and if there be more than one who have such majority, and have an equal number of votes, then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President; and if no person have a majority, then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President.

Ask_Politics,controversial,Why are US conservatives so open to pulling support from Ukraine but not Israel?,What gives? They're choosing the side that's been accused of genocide in both conflicts. ,23,19,4,"The two conflicts are thought of quite differently, speaking as a former conservative myself. We can stitch together a good answer from the evidence from Trump's first term, and how the modern conservative movement talks about the conflict.

 

Short Summary: **\*\*Conservatives are against funding Ukraine because of Trump's personal animosity against the country, top donor and adviser's empathy for Russia's position, and apathy about the stakes of the war either in Ukraine or Israel.\*\***

 

I'll break down the evidence from here to make the argument:

Part One:  

**\[\*\*1. Remember that Trump was first impeached in 2019 due to his attempt to blackmail Ukraine into announcing a public investigation into his political rival by withholding military aid and support.\*\*\]**([https://www.vox.com/c/2020/2/6/20914280/impeachment-trump-explained](https://www.vox.com/c/2020/2/6/20914280/impeachment-trump-explained))

 

The source above explains the details but the origin of the impeachment was because of a call Trump placed to the President of Ukraine directly asking him to investigate President Joe Biden's son so that he had something to smear him with ahead of the US presidential election in November. A whistleblower identified the call logs had been scrubbed, and identified Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani in concert with sympathetic businessmen in Ukraine and Russia were sent to negotiate further with Ukraine.

 

The specific ask, captured on the call logs between Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, was for Ukraine to ""do a favor"" and open an investigation into CrowdStrike (a cybersecurity company that was the subject of an election-related conspiracy theory Trump appeared to believe in) and to discuss with Rudy Giuliani an investigation into Hunter Biden.

 

Ukraine did not do this, although Zelenskyy's aide apparently entertained a chat with Giuliani. Because Ukraine did not follow through, Trump's administration did indeed withhold military aid mentioned on the phonecall that had already been approved for export. This led to a public investigation - of Trump - in the US by Congress, and ultimately to his impeachment. Trump has had a personal animosity against Ukraine ever since, according to lev Parnas, who was one of his original envoys in the blackmail effort alongside Rudy Giuliani: \[Why Donald Trump ‘hates Ukraine’ – POLITICO\]([https://www.politico.eu/article/why-donald-trump-hates-ukraine-us-congress-kyiv-war/](https://www.politico.eu/article/why-donald-trump-hates-ukraine-us-congress-kyiv-war/))

  \[Even further back, there was relatively little pushback from the Republican Party when Trump's top advisers asked to remove ""support for Ukraine"" from the official party platform in 2016.\]([https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mueller-asked-trump-2016-rnc-platform-change-ukraine/story?id=59476035](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mueller-asked-trump-2016-rnc-platform-change-ukraine/story?id=59476035))",1,2024-11-19 22:41:07,2024-11-28 15:33:21,0.6
Ask_Politics,controversial,Why are US conservatives so open to pulling support from Ukraine but not Israel?,What gives? They're choosing the side that's been accused of genocide in both conflicts. ,23,19,4,"The short and sweet of it - [Israel is an ally ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93United_States_relations)and Ukraine is not.  That's a big influence.

From here, things get a bit complicated and reams of digital ink could be burned in writing every possible way, but I'm going to focus on one point that I think is the ultimate reason: **Israel can win its war at our current level of support, Ukraine cannot.**

Unless we start giving much more lethal aid or directly intervene ourselves, there simply is no route for Ukraine to reclaim their lost territories.  While they were able to repel the initial attacks (especially in the north near Kyiv), you can find [time lapses showing the lines/territory](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/733fe90805894bfc8562d90b106aa895) and see that its basically settled into a front line in the east and along Dnipro River in the south - which is to be expected as rivers make for good fortification.  But in this case its also a problem for Ukraine, too, as they have to cross that river as well.

If we (or any European nation) is not willing to intervene and fight to help Ukraine retake those territories, then, in my view, it is almost immoral to continue to support Ukraine in what is a meatgrinder with one or two results - Ukraine eventually loses as Russia grinds on or we reach a stalemate where Russia itself finds its gains acceptable and stops pushing.  If we have to choose between a stalemate and a loss, I'll take the stalemate and believe we should push Ukraine to formalize it in a peace treaty.  Is it ideal?  Absolutely not.  I'd rather Ukraine kick in Russia's teeth... but they don't seem to have that capacity and at some point demographics start coming into play.  Does Ukraine want to sacrifice a [generation of young men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War#Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine)?

Compare that to Israel.  Hamas is all but defeated and the only reason it isn't... is due to the US constantly wanting Israel to be careful.  Its been so successful that its decided to open a second front and attack another group that has attacked it over the years in Lebanon and achieved the same result - Hezbollah has been critically degraded and [Lebanon is not in control of much of its south](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-price-lebanon-is-paying-for-the-hezbollah-israel-war), and Israel can strike anywhere in the country seemingly at will.  Even Iran, who twice has [fired at Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/02/west-defend-israel-iranian-attack), did basically no damage while[ Israel struck back into Iran with almost no issue](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr0yvrx4qpo).

  
Now, all this said, I think the US policy *is correct* in that we do not want either war to become something bigger - we do not want Russia to use nukes and we do not want Israel and Iran to go to war with each other.  With all of that above and those goals in place, what is the most likely want to achieve that?  Ultimately, it means pushing Ukraine to be realistic and pressing Israel to use restraint as necessary.  And I think we can achieve both under either Biden or Trump.",-3,2024-11-19 22:41:07,2024-11-21 20:00:19,-0.5

Russia has made a concerted - and successful - effort to influence top advisers within Trump's inner circle and the upper echelons of the Republican Party.\*\***

 

Little remembered now is the case of Maria Butina, a Russian intelligence officer that went undercover within the Republican Party to influence it from the inside, largely through growing connections to key Republican fundraisers and affiliated organizations like\[ Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne\]([https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/maria-butina-russia-spy-fbi-860256/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/maria-butina-russia-spy-fbi-860256/)) (a top Trump donor) and the \[National Rifle Association\]([https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44885633](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44885633)). This is but one example of a larger problem: There appears to have been a concerted effort by the Russian intelligence apparatus to at least seed the Republican Party with pro-Russia views, and that inevitably paid off later with a variety of people within Trump's inner circle echoing Russia's propaganda on its invasion of Ukraine and overtly supporting the Russian war effort.

 

Nowhere is this more obvious than in Elon Musk and David Sacks, two of Trump's most important donors for his 2024 campaign and two of his top advisers informing his transition and administration. \[Elon Musk was personally called upon by President Putin of Russia early in the war after Ukraine was found to be using Starlink communications equipment for its war effort.\]([https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/10/28/fiona-hill-explains-trump-musk-putin-00185820](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/10/28/fiona-hill-explains-trump-musk-putin-00185820)) He \[subsequently disabled Starlink connectivity for the Ukrainian military at critical points in the war\]([https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66752264](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66752264)), influenced by Putin's view that Ukraine could not catastrophically win against the Russian occupation.

 

To put another bow on it, Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's nominee for Director of National Intelligence, \[has been paid and feted by Russia's state-owned media circuit as far back as 2015.\]([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-trump-russia.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-trump-russia.html)) It is not clear these people want Ukraine to win the war - quite the opposite. They prefer Russia ultimately prevail.

 

To be clear, these people are not Russian intelligence sources or agents themselves. They likely genuinely believe what they say about Russia's position on the war for a variety of reasons -  For other folks in Trump's orbit like Gabbard, there is a mixture of plain antiwar feeling that favors Russia winning over any extended US role, as well as a sense of obligation after being so prominently boosted by Russia's state media and propaganda networks.",1,2024-11-19 22:41:07,2024-11-28 15:33:28,0.9

The [Fourteenth Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/amendment-14/section-1/) protects the right to move from one state to another. There is some amount of research into this topic, some suggesting that overall trends lead to outflow of wealthy citizens with increased income taxes. [Shocker: Wealthy Americans tend to flee high-income tax states](https://www.investmentnews.com/tax/shocker-wealthy-americans-tend-to-flee-high-income-tax-states/251879) (citing [The Introduction of the Income Tax, Fiscal Capacity, and Migration: Evidence from US States](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20210388)). Other studies have concluded that this is actually a minority factor in citizen movement, focusing on employment opportunities as a more powerful driver. [State Taxes Have a Minimal Impact on People’s Interstate Moves](https://www.cbpp.org/research/state-budget-and-tax/state-taxes-have-a-minimal-impact-on-peoples-interstate-moves). 

A wealth tax is new territory though, because we're talking about taxing people based on assets as opposed to income, Elizabeth Warren's proposal for example proposes an increased tax only on households with more than 50 million in assets, approximately the wealthiest 75,000 households. [Ultra-Millionaire Tax](https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/ultra-millionaire-tax). You didn't ask about the efficacy of these taxes and/or implementation, so I'm not going to touch on the nuance of the plans; that plan is a good example though, tax the absolute wealth-hoarders and leave everyone else untouched. 

If the Federal Government implemented such a plan, it's likely that the math would work out (depending on the proposal) that for *some* percentage of the ultra-wealthy population, it would make more sense to simply leave the country and not pay. Some are dual citizens and could renounce, others could renounce their citizenship and seek residency in one of the nations that allows investment residency/citizenship. Would anyone actually do that? we don't know, it depends on the individuals and the specific plan. It's tough to extricate yourself from a country, and it's tough to extricate yourself from the U.S. economy. These are the people who have the easiest time (financially) abandoning the country, but simultaneously some of the largest headaches (financially) when doing so. 

If a State Government implemented such a plan, the math of moving would probably be more appetizing for a LOT more people. There is no application process for moving a domicile. There is no need to shield assets, if you live somewhere else, the tax just doesn't apply. There is no need to stop doing business in the U.S.,  liquidate assets, or stop vacationing in your home state.  It would be appetizing to simply buy a home in another state, pretend to live there, and fraudulently establish the domicile. Obviously, I'm not condoning that behavior, and it wouldn't be legal, but it's practical. It's a lot easier to claim you live in Mississippi than to claim you live in Spain. 

You'll notice the last two paragraphs don't have citations, and that's because this is highly theoretical. We know the effect increased taxes have on movement between states. It's at least *a* factor, even if you don't agree it's *the* factor; in either case, the correlation is there. A wealth tax on the ultra-wealthiest by a state may or may not make citizens flee, but the calculation to do so would be far in their favor when compared to a federal tax.

He appointed the conservative judges who made the Supreme Court decision that has overturned Roe. 

>I don't get to the extent of what she will be able to do

A president has limited power in this respect. She can appoint progressive justices when seats open up, which could eventually (like a decade or two) reinstate Roe if control of the court flips. If she is willing to take steps Biden would not, she could expand the court or bypass the filibuster to allow congress to legislate a federal abortion protection. She has made one vague comment suggesting she might be willing to do something like this where Biden was unwilling. 

>In short, what will happen if either of these people get elected in terms of abortion?

In short, almost definitely nothing. If either president tries to immediately push for a federal law for or against abortion, they will be blocked by the filibuster in the senate. Republicans are unlikely to change filibuster rules because they face increasingly steep odds of keeping chamber control so the filibuster helps them more than it hurts them. Democrats under Harris might be willing to change rules, but Harris has a decent chance of coming into office without senate control this cycle, so it would take at least two years for democrats to gain control in midterm elections before they could push their agenda. 

In long? Republicans means less access to abortion and Democrats means more access. How this plays out can vary, as I've explained, but those are the clearly stated aims of the party platforms and no matter what other tactics are tried, court control is always an issue and will always play out the same way. Democrat control means judges more likely to support abortion access and Republican control means more likely to restrict it.",41,2024-11-01 00:44:40,2024-11-01 13:40:31,0.0

Thank you for responding in advance ",50,44,6,"*Roe v. Wade* was a 50 year-old Supreme Court decision that, along with some subsequent decisions, gave women nationwide the right to terminate their pregancies up until the point of fetal viability, which means until the fetus could conceivably survive outside the womb. That translated to around 24 weeks.

In 2016, when Trump was campaigning for President, he promised he would nominate Supreme Court justices who would overturn *Roe v. Wade.* Publicly stating a legal litmus test for Supreme Court justices was highly unorthodox and frowned upon, because those judges are ostensibly just supposed to interpret the law, not come in with preconceived notions. But Trump did make that promise, and once elected, he fulfilled it. 

As a result, anti-abortion groups made various attempts to get a case before the newly shifted court and they were eventually successful in getting *Roe v. Wade* overturned with the ""Dobbs"" decision, thereby leaving the terms of abortion rights to individual state governments, some of which have severely restricted those rights, or may in the future. Others have reaffirmed the rights. 

So, presently, whether or not a woman has a right to an abortion, and the degree to which said right is restricted, depends entirely on which state she lives in, not what her doctor recommends.

Trump immediately took credit for overturning the national right to abortion and has continued to do so in the present campaign. He says leaving the determination to individual states' governments was the right one.

Kamala Harris, if elected, is unlikely to have an opportunity to appoint different justices in the next four years, because the conservatives currently on the bench are unlikely to vacate their seats during her presidency. What she has said, instead, is that if the Congress passes a bill to restore the protections under *Roe v. Wade* — a nationwide right to abortion up to the point of fetal viability — she would sign it into law. The chances of Congress passing such a bill are not high, however, because the legislature is pretty evenly split right now. It's likely Harris would take other measures to protect abortion rights where she can, though, such as in the military and by providing support for women who need to travel to other states to get such care.",7,2024-11-01 00:44:40,2024-11-01 23:13:17,0.6

Thank you for responding in advance ",50,44,6,"Don't be fooled Roe V Wade was always a temporary measure. Was never a law and it was always going to be overturned if it ever went to the Supreme Court. Let me explain:

We are not a Democracy,  are a Constitutional Republic, what does that mean?
It means that we can make laws and vote for or against anything as long as it doesn't violate the Constitution. Our founding fathers wanted it this way after having experienced tyranny at the hands of the British Monarchy.

Abortion has never been a constitutionally protected right. I am not saying abortion is good nor bad, I'll stay out of that debate only saying that its not constitutionally protected.

Since the Supreme Court can only rule on weather something is Constitutional or not they had to overturn it. 

If you think Abortion should be protected by the constitution that an amendment needs to be added to the Constitution, and there are ways to do it. 

If not then it goes back to the individual states (in this case) to allow or not allow abortion.

This also means that Trump cannot outlaw abortion if he wins, nor can Veep Harris overturn the Supreme Court rulling.

Thank you for responding in advance ",50,44,6,"Roe V Wade was overturned by the supreme court since it was unconstitutional. Now, states can decide how to progress on legality of abortion. If you're in California, you can still twerk-abort babies on stage, but now if you're in Texas, you can be hunted down and arrested for having an abortion.

Basically, it is a state decision on how to rule on it, which I think is very fair considering there are such populations groups for and against abortion. They should make it so states like Texas can't arrest Californians for having abortions in California, but by that logic, Texans should not be allowed to get abortions in California unless they move.

Ultimately this all works if the federal government restricts any state for imposing their laws on those of another state. Without that, this is highly unconstitutional. (i won't get into the morality of abortion, however, as that depends on the person).",1,2024-11-01 00:44:40,2024-11-05 03:15:23,0.10

Thank you for responding in advance ",50,44,6,"I feel like the modern day pharisees have brainwashed America. On lots of things but it shows the most with abortion right now. Where in the bible does it say life starts at conception?? It doesn't. It says life starts in the womb which... duh. Historically people believed this occurred with quickening or baby kicks. Or now we also know that babies brains aren't developed until month 5 when they are able to experience feelings and start to become viable. Whereas the ""heartbeat"" fallacy is a lie because there is NO HEART at week 6. 

Why do conservatives care? Voters care because they THINK they're being Christian. Im Christian and I follow my heart and my faith and I think this hides a big lie. The real reason the GOP cares is because 1) the birth rate is shrinking and the alternative to population growth is immigration which isn't desirable among white supremacists and 2) the traditional values mascarades the belief that women belong barefoot in the kitchen serving their husband's. The latter is also why GOP aims to decimate public education. And ironically taking women out of the workforce HURTS THE ECONOMY. But theres lots of contradictions here including the fact that:

Christ said love thy neighbor as thyself. Not ""unless you're straight"" and not ""America first"" and not ""only after you've made a homemade arsenal.""

 Politics bring out the evil in people and the day that Reaghan turned Christianity into a strategy is the start to where we are now.  Trump has only taken this drive and exploited it.",1,2024-11-01 00:44:40,2024-11-06 02:34:03,0.9

Yes, that's historically how it was done. So if Nebraska has 2 Republicans and 1 Democrat, the Republicans can vote and cast Nebraska's one vote for Trump.

African Americans, jews, the religiously unaffiliated, other religious minorities, urban voters,, unmarried momen, LGBT+ People, People with graduate degrees,

This is the Republican Coalition:

If anyone thinks I'm an idiot I not only will not be offended but will welcome the opportunity to learn something from better minds than mine.

I have been interested in this question for decades now. The big shift in the coalitions that form the two parties occurred [between FDR and Nixon](https://www.studentsofhistory.com/ideologies-flip-Democratic-Republican-parties), but the parties have continued to evolve since then and we seem to be in the middle of another realignment right now as the working class moves from the Democrats over to the Republican camp.  

After Nixon, we had the transition between Reagan and Clinton when Clinton (in response to Reagan's landslide) shifted the Democratic party to the right from [Liberal to Neo-Liberal](https://news.ucsb.edu/2024/021387/historian-nelson-lichtenstein-clinton-betrayed-progressives-capitulated-right).  Today the Republicans are following suit in response to Obama's popularity by shifting again, which you can see in the [Gallup polling](https://news.gallup.com/poll/388781/political-party-preferences-shifted-greatly-during-2021.aspx), but I'm not sure where too. Democrats OTOH are on their back foot.  They are being reacted to by the general population, but have not yet reached the point of redefining themselves and explaining what they stand for and then selling that to the modern age. What I mostly hear from the political left today is ""of course we are right, we have always been right"" but a lot of the nation has forgotten what that even means.  

For me, the coalitions that make up the two parties today fall into four groups:

Fringe groups that don't really have a choice. These groups are actually outliers but each party points to them as representative of what the other part stands for:

Republican | Democrat
:--|:--
White nationalists | Communists 
Militia groups | Anti-Capitalists (e.g. Antifa)

Less government vs. More government groups represent what has been the core principles of each party, but may be shifting given the past few elections. 

Republican | Democrat
:--|:--
Rural | Urban

Also while the Democrats *could* put together a coalition large enough to win, as we saw in '20, but they've splintered a lot and there's so much infighting, especially with the divide between liberals and leftists as well as their foreign policy.

Obviously anyone who says that he is ""in office"" right now, today, is mistaken, but he will be in office in just a bit over 2 months, so pretty soon.

Giving them the benefit of the doubt, they aren't referring to a particular law or policy, but that voters, knowing what was at stake, chose the candidate who would not protect abortion access over one who would.

The most likely changes regarding abortion policy under a Trump administration are going to be court-related. The Biden administration has been willing to sue states that it felt made abortion restrictions that were too restrictive (and Idaho's was partially overturned by SCOTUS because it conflicted with federal law). The Trump administration is unlikely to continue to challenge states' abortion restrictions in court.

Additionally, Trump will be able to appoint more federal judges, making it more likely for the courts to uphold strict abortion laws. One of Trump's previous appointees went so far as to issue a ruling that rescinded FDA approval for one of the main abortion medications, but he was overturned on appeal. A second Trump administration allows more like-minded judges to be appointed and possibly at to higher levels.

Additionally additionally, some localities are trying to enact laws that would punish people for even *traveling through* to obtain an abortion. A Trump administration might or might not challenge such laws, but a Harris administration certainly would have.",6,2024-11-07 02:57:35,2024-11-07 21:06:14,0.6

At this time, whether a woman has bodily autonomy after becoming pregnant depends entirely on where she lives and/or whether she has the resources to get somewhere else. In states with Trump abortion bans--whether Florida's now-permanent 6-week ban, or those states where the ban starts at a time when women CAN actually know they are pregnant--women lose bodily autonomy the moment they become pregnant. At that point, the state can regulate, control, and punish what she eats and drinks, where she goes, how she behaves, etc. There are women in jail today for ""endangering an unborn child"" for the decisions made before or after learning they were pregnant. 

The MAGA legislators have no intention of ""leaving it to the states,"" BTW, no matter what Trump says. There is a national ban coming--and even if there is no national ban, if you live in a state with a ban, it might as well be national. Moreover, even if a woman has no intention of ever having an abortion, in states like Texas now, the laws are such that if she comes to a point where she needs one to save her life and fertility, her doctor risks a 99-year prison sentence for performing a life-saving abortion that is later deemed by some law-enforcement agent as not having been necessary. 

And, to be clear, there is no situation in this country where a man who has not been at least accused of a crime can be stripped of his bodily autonomy. Nor do the partners of pregnant women have their rights revoked in any way whatsoever. 

That's why. Women no longer have a voice in what happens to them once they become pregnant, depending on what state they live in.",6,2024-11-07 02:57:35,2024-11-09 22:09:22,0.9

These Supreme Court justices said they would not get rid of Roe vs. Wade and then they did it anyway. Once that was done, Republican controlled states were able to enact strict abortion bans. For example, Texas bans abortions after 6 weeks. (Weeks of pregnancy start on the day of your last menstrual period, so at ""6 weeks"" it has only been 2 weeks since you missed your period. This gives you very little time to decide what to do next.)

Texas is supposed to allow exceptions for abortion if the mother's life is threatened, but it also says doctors will get life in prison for ""murder"" if they perform an abortion outside of these circumstances. No one has clearly defined what a life threatening condition during pregnancy really is, and doctors don't want to get life in prison, so they are waiting too long to perform life saving abortions. Now multiple women in Texas have died and lost fertility from care being delayed (even women who had wanted, planned pregnancies). The maternal mortality rate in Texas is up over 50% since these laws were enacted in 2021. In states without these laws, the maternal mortality rate is up 11%. 

I live in Texas and my husband and I are talking about moving because we want to have a baby in a few years. I would be scared of dying from a preventable death if I were pregnant in this state. It's sad because we have built our lives here and I really don't want to move, but it does make me nervous.

The US, Israel, and Russia are all not state parties to the statute which binds a state to apprehend a person under an ICC warrant. 

If either of those people were to enter territory controlled by any state on that list, then that party would be compelled to arrest them and transfer them to appear before the ICC.  

The ICC will do its best to locate and maintain information about them.  They are also able to utilize non state entities to assist in capture and transport as they see fit. 

How that would play out in reality given who these people are is anyone's guess.

Thanks for your answers <3",5,4,1,"Answer: US government is composed of three main branches. The Legislative branch, the House and Senate create laws, and the Executive branch, the President enacts those laws by signing (or not- by using the veto power the president holds). The Judicial branch enforces those laws. By using case law to interpret how and when those laws are to be enforced.

In 1990 Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities act into law. It said essentially that the government and other entities offering services to the public cannot discriminate against persons with disabilities. Sounds great, right? Except it was, like many laws, kinda vague on just what form that discrimination had to take to be in violation of the law. Mostly in how the law applied when an entity was remodeling, or renovating, or otherwise altering an existing structure or facility. 

Enter [Kinney V Yerusalem:](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/812/547/1761223/) A group of persons with disabilities sued a State transportation department for violating the ADA. When the State repaved a road, they argued, it had the legal responsibility under the ADA to also install compliant curb ramps at every crosswalk on that road. Because crosswalks are a public facility, and by not making them compliant the State was in violation of the law.

The State argued that their concern was only the road, the crosswalks and curb ramps were not required to be upgraded at that time.

The Supreme Court ruled that, no, by paving the road they were altering the existing crosswalks and thus triggering the legal requirement to upgrade them.  

So case law determines how and when laws are to be applied for those times the law isn't clear. That's the power SCOTUS has and is why case law is so important in the US legal system. There are many more fascinating cases where the courts ruled in ways that importantly affected just how and when laws are applied.",5,2024-11-14 20:04:03,2024-11-15 03:12:40,0

Thanks for your answers <3",5,4,1,"The United States, like most former British colonies, has a ""common law"" judicial system, which means that the Constitution and the Laws passed by congress are interpreted by the courts based on the past rulings of courts called ""precedent."" The government is expected to apply that ruling going forward, and other courts are expected to interpret following that ruling until Congress changes the law or the Supreme Court changes its decision (which is supposed to happen very rarely but is increasingly common)  gave a good description of what that looks like in practice

Almost all European countries (except Britain and Ireland) have a judicial system based on a ""civil code"", where judges interpret the law based on written law codes and do not consider the rulings of past courts.

So, in the US (and any common law system), one Supreme Court ruling can dramatically change how a law is applied for decades to come, whereas, in a Civil Code system, one ruling only affects the narrow issue it is being applied to.

Arguably the paradox was the expansion of voting rights without addressing the initial system. The US was originally set up for minority rule. There was no expectation by the founders that pretty much every citizen would have the right to vote. They were also very careful and it seems fearful of the situation we have today which is that large numbers of people flood to the most productive and lucrative states. This would potentially strip all/most power from wealthy elites who may not live there.

The goal is to make answers better sourced and try to get higher quality sources as well.  We've still got a ways to go, but this should help.

The **first change** is to Rule 3 and top-level comments.  Before it was *heavily* suggested to include sources and **now it will become a requirement** and enforced by the automod.  In almost every case I can think of, you can find a source to backup your reply to the question, whether its Wikipedia, a news article or even a link to primary source such as a video or transcript.  If for some reason we find an edge case where there is no ability to provide a source, it can be appealed (detailed below)

The **second change** is not so much a specific rule but how we will view sources and that we will encourage *primary* sources to be used to reinforce *secondary* sources.  As a reminder, primary sources are the raw event generally recorded around the same time it was said, written, or done - a video of a politician's speech, a court opinion and so on.  A secondary source is one who takes that primary source and generally analyzes it or summarizes it for easier consumption - in this case, an opinion article about that court ruling or a YouTuber digesting what a proposed new law would mean.  The goal of this change is to try to get as close to the primary source, the raw information, as possible and then use the secondary sources to reinforce your post.  

For example, let's say Ronald McDonald said he'd provide free kids meals to fight childhood hunger, you'd link to the clown actually saying it on video or the release from the Office of Ronald McDonald.  But then, seeing as this might have impacts down the road, you might link to Burger King News calling the new plan a threat  (""flame-grilled is better"") and their opinion that this will lead to further childhood obesity.

The ultimate goal of this rule is to help establish the facts surrounding the question so our time here isn't spent arguing over that (the raw data is there for anyone to see) but rather trying to explain what it means or how it works.  This will also help with baseless claims or bad takes since they'll be forced to address the ultimate source rather than sticking to talking points - which will help keeping things from breaking Rule 4.

Finally, the **last change** will generally just be better rule enforcement.  Given the period, we let posts through that were not formatted as a question, some bad punctuation and grammar, as well as some ""short"" questions that didn't quite demonstrate that the poster had tried to do some research themselves.  We will begin starting to enforce this more rigorously going forward.

Now, one last thing - **the appeals process**.  With anything removed by automod, there's a small link that says ""ask for a second opinion in modmail"".  Click this, explain yourself/make your case and we'll review as soon as possible.  Most of the appeal wins are because of our curse-word filter where a really good post gets removed for quoting someone saying one of them.  We'd rather be safe than sorry.  For active moderation where we take action ourselves, we'll start using the mod tools to post the reasons we're removing posts and comments.  And we'll also go back and expand the automod's reason from ""short response"" to ""This reply was removed because it was a very short response which generally does not adequately answer the question.""  Or something like that.

It'll be a few days before we get all of this implemented, so please bear with us.  But that's it for now.  I hope you all have a great day and we look forward to elevating the discussion here at /r/ask_politics.

The goal is to make answers better sourced and try to get higher quality sources as well.  We've still got a ways to go, but this should help.

The **first change** is to Rule 3 and top-level comments.  Before it was *heavily* suggested to include sources and **now it will become a requirement** and enforced by the automod.  In almost every case I can think of, you can find a source to backup your reply to the question, whether its Wikipedia, a news article or even a link to primary source such as a video or transcript.  If for some reason we find an edge case where there is no ability to provide a source, it can be appealed (detailed below)

The **second change** is not so much a specific rule but how we will view sources and that we will encourage *primary* sources to be used to reinforce *secondary* sources.  As a reminder, primary sources are the raw event generally recorded around the same time it was said, written, or done - a video of a politician's speech, a court opinion and so on.  A secondary source is one who takes that primary source and generally analyzes it or summarizes it for easier consumption - in this case, an opinion article about that court ruling or a YouTuber digesting what a proposed new law would mean.  The goal of this change is to try to get as close to the primary source, the raw information, as possible and then use the secondary sources to reinforce your post.  

For example, let's say Ronald McDonald said he'd provide free kids meals to fight childhood hunger, you'd link to the clown actually saying it on video or the release from the Office of Ronald McDonald.  But then, seeing as this might have impacts down the road, you might link to Burger King News calling the new plan a threat  (""flame-grilled is better"") and their opinion that this will lead to further childhood obesity.

The ultimate goal of this rule is to help establish the facts surrounding the question so our time here isn't spent arguing over that (the raw data is there for anyone to see) but rather trying to explain what it means or how it works.  This will also help with baseless claims or bad takes since they'll be forced to address the ultimate source rather than sticking to talking points - which will help keeping things from breaking Rule 4.

Finally, the **last change** will generally just be better rule enforcement.

So what I would do in this example would be to do a google search for something like ""conservative opinion on gay marriage polling over time"", open a handful of replies in new tabs, and pick one or more sources which contain recent and relevant data and links to primary sources (or at least say exactly where the data came from) if it isn't a primary source itself.  Heck, you should do this before you start writing, so you don't find yourself wasting time.

[This was one of the top results I got](https://news.gallup.com/poll/646202/sex-relations-marriage-supported.aspx), which includes polling data from 1996 to 2024 showing that support for gay marriage among republicans increased from 16% in '96 to 46% in 2024, with a peak of 55% in '21-'22.

As for the *whys* that would be more speculative, I agree, but it's good to start with a framework that supports the premise.  But even still, the ""Bottom Line"" touches on it to an extent:

>As the percentage of Americans who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or something other than heterosexual continues to rise in the U.S., public support for same-sex marriage and views of the morality of same-sex relations remain high

...

>With younger Americans consistently more likely than older Americans to favor legal same-sex marriage and to view same-sex relations as morally acceptable, public support should resume its growth at some point in the coming decades, should younger adults and new generations entering adulthood maintain higher levels of support.

Circumstantial evidence is leagues better than no evidence, you just have to work a bit harder to make your case than if you had a smoking gun.  And if nothing else, it can be helpful to be clear which parts of an argument are backed by hard data, which are supported by circumstantial evidence, and which is speculation grounded more in lived experience and anecdotes.

If you wanted to argue that greater representation in media is a factor, you could include a quote [like this](https://student.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/2022/02/17/lgbt-history-month-a-history-of-lgbt-representation-in-tv-film/comment-page-1/) (from a quick google for ""gay representation in media over time""):

>Since 2005, GLAAD has published an annual report to show how representation is changing in TV. In the 2005-2006 season, 1.4% of regular characters on broadcast primetime shows were LGBTQ+, whilst in 2020-2021, the figure was up to 9.1% – and over half of these characters were people of colour. It is important to remember though that more can be done – the most recent study found that 20% of these LGBTQ+ characters appeared in a series created by just 1 of 4 TV producers.

And while we've all heard that correlation does not necessarily imply causation, it's not like the correlation proves the opposite either.  Not a smoking gun, but a plausible basis for further argumentation.",2,2024-11-13 18:32:29,2024-11-13 20:32:45,0.3

Well....

In 2011, the Vermont legislature passed Act 48, allowing Vermont to replace its current fragmented system--which is driving unsustainable health care
costs-- with Green Mountain Care, the nation’s first universal, publicly financed health care system

Vermont's single payer system would have to be financially supported through a payroll tax.

*  12.5 percent in 2015 and 11.6 percent in 2019, including a 3 percent contribution from employees.

--------
In 2014, Vermont's legislator changed the plan and decided that raising state income taxes up to 9.5 percent and placing an 11.5 percent Corp Tax Rate on Business was the only way to fund the expenses.

Calling it the biggest disappointment of his career, Gov. Peter Shumlin says he is abandoning plans to make Vermont the first state in the country with a universal, publicly funded health care system.

> * I have supported a universal, publicly financed health care system my entire public life, and
believe that all Vermonters deserve health care as a right, regardless of employment or income.
Our current way of paying for health care is inequitable. I wanted to fix this at the state level, and
I thought we could. I have learned that the limitations of state-based financing – limitations of
federal law, limitations of our tax capacity, and sensitivity of our economy – make that unwise
and untenable at this time.

* Today we are releasing the [Green Mountain Care financing report](https://hcr.vermont.gov/sites/hcr/files/pdfs/GMC%20FINAL%20REPORT%20123014.pdf) we developed that led me to
the difficult conclusion that now is not the time to move forward with a publicly-financed health
care system in Vermont. In the coming weeks we will be publishing additional materials from
our research on the website http://hcr.vermont.gov/library. Vermonters will have access to all of
the analysis that we used to come to the difficult decision we made.
I hope this report gives us a common understanding of the detailed assumptions and facts needed
for the work we must do over the coming legislative session to continue long-lasting, meaningful
health care reform in Vermont.

>“These are simply not tax rates that I can responsibly support or urge the Legislature to pass,” the Governor said. “In my judgment, the potential economic disruption and risks would be too great to small businesses, working families and the state’s economy.”",5,2024-11-12 20:17:58,2024-11-13 02:41:52,0.6

Trump has made clear through statements and past actions that tariffs will only be used as leverage - not economic doctrine. He intends to implement a 10% tariff on China unless they give him assurances that fentanyl manufacturers and smugglers will be dealt with harshly (as in he has asked for death penalty).

It seems kind of convenient conservatives are jumping on [this latest talking point from Trump](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg7y52n411o) as a kind of off-ramp for his tariff rhetoric. Previously he's made explicitly [economic justifications](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/tariffs-tax-cuts-core-trumps-economic-pitch-voters-2024-09-24/) for his incredibly broad tariff plans. Its good for the US that even conservatives are starting to acknowledge how disastrous his earlier tariff proposals were but its not as if he's giving us reason to believe he'll be consistent. 

>A 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico will be imposed if they do not agree to his demands regarding illegal immigration and drugs. Both of these countries will most likely oblige because they do not want a 25% tariff.

We (and I mean the US public, Mexico, China and likely Trump himself) don't even know what those demands look like in reality. Its an amorphous target that could easily be used as a justification for Trump to impose tariffs whenever he wants to. 

>What is key to remember is that tariffs are not his economic doctrine - they are a power tool and leverage. In the first trump administration, he used similar methods with no inflationary pressure from tariffs.

>Remember he actually does not want tariffs - he is the one who threw NAFTA and came up with USMCA. That's a good representation of what it actually is.

Again, I sure hope you're right. Relying on the idea that a notoriously capricious man was just lying about his central (only?) economic strategy doesn't really inspire much confidence. 

>Trump's nominee for Treasury Sec Scott Bessent has said the President-elect does not intend to implement these tariffs if demands are met

Trump nominated a known [tariff hawk](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/19/howard-lutnick-commerce-secretary-trump-pick-00189339) as Commerce secretary (who would actually be implementing his tariff regime).

Just wondering what caused the masses to believe it was a good idea, and just why everyone cared worldwide",37,35,2,"TL;DR: Many voters did not fully grasp what Brexit would mean in practice. Many Leave voters were surprised that Vote Leave actually won. In the end Brexit turned out to include many trade-offs that had not been put on the foreground, which made the process way more difficult and lengthier than expected by ordinary voters.

The outcome of the 2016 Brexit referendum was close: 51.9% voted Leave and 48.1% voted Remain ([BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/eu_referendum/results)). The most important concerns for Leave voters were sovereignty and immigration, whereas the most important concern for Remain voters was the economy ([UK in a Changing Europe](https://ukandeu.ac.uk/other-publication/peoples-stated-reasons-for-voting-leave-or-remain/)). 

Leave voters felt that too many laws were made in Brussels by the (unelected bureaucrats of the) EU, with not enough say over these laws by the UK. These concerns were strongly pushed by the British tabloid press ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/06/21/482952581/bendy-bananas-and-barmaid-bosoms-the-u-k-s-crazy-anti-eu-food-myths)), but saying that an unpopular policy was demanded by Brussels/the EU was often a convenient way for British ministers to avoid having to take responsibility for agreeing to these policies in the first place or even adding extra rules on top (a practice known as gold-plating). The Vote Leave campaign aptly summed up the desire for more sovereignty with the slogan 'Take Back Control'. They also pointed towards the high contribution of the UK to the EU budget and suggested that these funds could be better spent at home, for example on the National Health Service. They put this on a red bus and drove it all around the country ([BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42698981)). 

In 2004 ten countries in Central and Eastern Europe became new members of the EU. That meant that their citizens got the right to work in other EU Member States, including the UK. As a result, a large number of these citizens moved to the UK for work. This fueled the idea in the UK that there were just too many East Europeans in the country  and that this led to wage suppression and by voting for Brexit these immigrants would leave again. In addition, in 2015 there was a large uncontrolled influx of people from the Middle East and Africa into the EU. Many Brits were concerned with possibly large numbers of asylum seekers arriving in Britain, which was also fueled by the British tabloid press ([UK in a Changing Europe](https://ukandeu.ac.uk/tabloid-tales-how-the-tabloid-press-shaped-the-brexit-vote/)). A related concern was that Turkey was a candidate country for membership of the EU and this might in the future also lead to a large number of Turkish migrants moving to the UK.",5,2024-11-13 16:54:50,2024-11-13 23:52:05,0

Ask_Politics,controversial,How to start with ideologies and right-wing left-wing things?,"I’m a younger teenager and i’m very confused about all the ideologies. What are their basic beliefs and such, all research I try to do is either so dumbed down and what the would teach in school, or just people who already identify with an ideology and are making arguments about it. Where do I start? How do I identify myself so I don’t feel like an unaware sheep? I just get very mixed up with all the antifa, communist, anti-antifa, far-left, far-right, socialism, nazis, and stuff.",19,16,3,"You don't need to identify yourself with an ideology group. You just need to understand your stance on the issues you care about and be able to talk about that stance competently. It's okay to not have a stance on issues that are important to other people. It's also okay to change your stance when exposed to new information.

The idea that you need to categorize yourself into a certain ideological bucket is a propaganda method meant to get you to identify with the more palatable aspects of an ideology so you are more likely to agree with the less palatable aspects of that ideology. It also gets you emotionally invested in defending aspects of that ideology when presented with contradictory evidence.

When political scientists categorize people into ideology groups, it's a method of describing behavior. When people start identifying with those descriptors, it becomes a method of prescribing behavior and enforcing it on other people.

You don't need to play that game. You can be a perfectly well informed politically invested individual and not identify with any ideology. Eventually, you might accept an identity as a description of your beliefs, but you don't need to tie yourself to that identity. If you are pro-widget and are called a widgetist, it's okay to call youself a widgetist. It's also okay to stop calling yourself a widgetist when other people who call themselves widgetists start believing in something you don't believe in.

Whatever you do, don't go chasing political compass or its derivatives. They're designed specifically to get you to identify with weird idiosyncratic identities so you feel ostracized from the mainstream. If you want to read a dense philosophical work on the subject of identity and politics, I highly recommend [Hannah Arendt's *The Human Condition*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Human_Condition_(Arendt_book\)).",48,2024-12-30 05:27:46,2024-12-30 17:49:02,0

Within the category of communism, for instance, you have Trotskyists, Council Communists, Maoists, Titoists, Luxembourgists, Eurocommunists, and about 100 more, all of whom can talk for hours about how they are the ""true communists."" This is more or less the case for all the categories you mentioned.

A good place to start, though, would be a textbook.[ This is the textboo](https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393542240)k I used in college, which has a ten-page section on Political Ideologies that gives a very basic overview.

A little more advanced is the book [Ideology: A short introduction](https://academic.oup.com/book/768), chapters 6 and 7 will give you a more extended but still simplified overview. The rest of the book is metacommentary on what even is an ideology, which is also interesting but not exactly what you are asking about.

Even though each political label has a culture surrounding it, the fact is that these ideologies are more like a constellation of common viewpoints than something monolithic. There's a lot of variation in there. It's like a bunch of different variables united by a generally similar set of values and not so much a uniform thing.

If you want to dig in a little bit on what the major political parties in the US believe, I'd recommend a data-driven approach. As in, take a look at some polls about where voters in each party stand. This will give you a cleaner idea of what people believe, without the heavy editorialization you can often find in places like YouTube. Of course, feel free to read/watch/listen to as much editorialization as you want but sometimes it's hard to sort out the facts from partisan rhetoric.

A good source is the Pew Research Center. They release poll-based reports on about a monthly basis (sometimes a little more frequently.) https://www.pewresearch.org/topic/politics-policy/partisanship-issues/?_formats=report",3,2024-12-30 05:27:46,2025-01-01 18:26:55,0

Browse the shelves of your [local library](https://www.careeronestop.org/LocalHelp/CommunityServices/find-libraries.aspx).

Politics is a means to promoting specific outcomes, exercising and maintaining power. If you want to develop your sense of politics, develop your sense of morality. You can always evaluate a political outcome on the basis of your own internal moral compass.

To understand why we need society, government and politics you can look at what happens when power structures are left unchecked. 

If you want to understand how people survive political oppression you could read Viktor Frankl - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man%27s\_Search\_for\_Meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man%27s_Search_for_Meaning) he was a psychotherapist imprisoned in concentration camps by the Nazis.

You can read up on the Trail of Tears or Pinochet's Chile. Take any example from the list of human atrocities we have committed on each other and you begin to see why we need to center uplifting humanity in all facets of life. Go from there.

Yes there exists a degree of economic coercion and lack of options that a specific person might be experiencing which would be strong enough to negate their consent, but not all of us are experiencing that extent of duress. When you use a blanket label you deny our ability to characterize our own experiences and identify our own trauma. If our work is inherently rape, what are we supposed to call it when we actually get raped? 
  
You also equate vastly different circumstances as being the same thing, when identifying those circumstances is very important for actually responding to them.

When a person actively participates in harm, it is valid they will be harmed.  

It is very interesting how people tend to not care until directly affected.  

Does societal polarization sometimes happen?  Of course.  And that pressure, build up, and release is inevitable.  

If a solution happens, then progress is made, and the next pressure situation will be further away.  

If deterioration happens, then more events and retaliations will occur until a new equilibrium happens.  That will eventually repeat more pressure situations, and more events, etc, until a solution happens.   

Luigi accomplished much.  

Serial killers that are known for imitation, and fame-seeking after being caught, come to mind.  They're of a particular psychology of wanting to harm.  They're hated, ignored, used for entertainment be media and true crime enthusiasts.  A fame from how audiences like to be disgusted at something wrong.  A morbid curiosity.  

Vigilantism will appeal to those who want to harm someone who did verifiable wrong.  Dexter type of mindset. V for Vendetta.  People who want to be famous, popular, and LOVED for the murders they committed.  The more accurate, the better, because the evidence and validation will be undeniable.  

School shootings/mass shootings are theorized as being more and more often due to unresolved social issues locally combining with an awareness of past shootings.  

It's not rocket science to understand the inevitably of people seeing serial killers, school shootings, and Luigi, and then wanting to do something not to harm or ""randomly make people hurt"", but instead target for a ""cause.""  

Do you remember the church burnings and the abortion clinic bombings/shootings of the 80s/90s?  

Information age and callous meme culture are a breeding ground for incels that either want to MAGA something via force, or want to retaliate against such via force.  Some will want fame.  Some will do it for patriotism.  And the most successful won't be known of.  Accidents. 

The Racine/Kenosha kid who shot 2 people, he was from Indiana iirc?  He is talked about favorably for being ""involved"" in a quasi militia event...  It only takes 1, then 1 more, then 1 more... and we're already witness to it.  

We've seen the Conservative side of extremism more often. And the disenfranchised/bullied side.  It's only a matter of when, until another Stone Wall and Kent State happen, and people back then assumed ""cops are doing their best,"" and that's gone now.  We'll probably see a full police department building being bombed within the next 20 years, factoring the likelihood of precipitating events that will be causal to such.

AllTheLeft,top,Change my mind!,,503,503,0,"Doctors do help people without any money, literally, always...  

Then hospital billing sends the patients an inflated bill.

Hospitals that became ""for profit"" had CEO/upper management (those without any medical education and only 4 years of business classes) interfering with medical decisions. 

A doctor having to have billing pre-approve a treatment or risk being fired meant billing (with even less education) were simply following a flowchart of yes/no made from some incompetent management with some medical advisory inputs...  

That resulted in denying treatments unless immanent/urgent care was required.  So preventive measures were denied, the most cost-effective and sustainable.  And things like having a risk became a debate.  

Many of the people who literally died because of lack of insurance were falling into a loophole of having been told they wouldn't be covered unless ""in an emergency"" and told the cost would be thousands, so they went home, emergency happened as Doctors knew it would, and patients died because of hospital and insurance policies causing a high amount of fatalities of preventable deaths.  

The ""lucky"" uninsured arrive at the hospital in time to receive treatment and left with bills and lack of followup care, with instructions that they have to use the emergency room.  

Technically, Americans can get ""free"" Healthcare if they're willing to go into debt and declare medical bankruptcy repeatedly, and roll the cost onto the government and lawsuits.  But working class who pay into medical coverage would, as they have, split into blaming the system for being incorrect, or, blaming the poor for being poor and hoping the working class don't become a victim to the working class' ignorance.  

The CEO is a murderer, because insurance is supposed to be zero sum.  The CEO actively participated in taking insurance money meant for patients into lining pockets of people sitting on their asses.  

Insurance is supposed to use profit to pad for rainy days.  The workers from the bottom to the top get livable wages.  Medicine and Medications and Hospitals are supposed to be zero sum.  Profits are reinvested into equipment and staff education.  

Food, shelter, medicine, insurance, transportation, education are supposed to be zero sum.  Profits are supposed to be reinvested into the maintenance and advancement of progress and set aside for creating surplus.   

Very few things are actually a scarcity.  The amount of land needed to feed 6 billion is already available.  Energy crisis is fake, as most things can be turned off at night (waste of consumption).  Medicines are simply chemical compounds of reactions and the infrastructure already exists to provide medications for pennies (arguably costs are driven higher due to the needed FDA process and how companies greed causes a ""back to square one"" costly procedure of adherence--if they weren't trying to rush a drug to competitive market, the university scene and global community would have created free medicine and the companies wouldn't have hoarding).  Automobiles would be safer, lighter, and slower, built for function and public transportation incredibly strong.  

Capitalism and ""price gouging"" of resources is basically a monopoly of hush-hush, causing most things to be a false scarcity.   

There is no conspiracy.  It is simply all of humanity glances at their cultures and decides how to navigate.  Capitalists decided to climb to the top and oppress competition, ironically setting themselves up for being oppressed as competition, resulting in a gridlock of a few  temporarily successful at a Hunger Games/Highlander type of situation.  Hence, the competitive mindset to adhere into the conformity of their own abuse instead of breaking the cycle. 

Capitalism is similar to Domestic Violence.  It is self perpetuating.  One side is wanting to win and throws fists, the other wanting for something better, and the kids grow up perpetuating the same, trying to be winners at a game that forces losers.  

I partly admire Capitalism for not being the ""best"" economic system, but the economic system that seems to include the most. It doesn't ask much of the citizens to be civilized or educated or enlightened.  Socialism and Communism require advanced citizens and participation and understanding.  Capitalism is simply how a person learns to hustle or get hustled.  Predator or Prey.  It's a very primitive understanding that appeals to primitive people.  It is a system that is unapologetically traitorous towards its participants.  

Theoretically, Capitalism is supposed to self-adjust and self-resolve due to strikes, quitting, theft, and murder.  It's a free-for-all battle royale, and law is used as an attempt to oppress competition.  

Problems with oppressing your own populace though, is black markets form.  And that cold apathy plays harsh.  Once organized crime happens, and the government cannot be trusted, the citizens become apathetic towards ""sides"" and basically won't help a criminal nor a cop, but would help only who they favor.  Mexico has so many political assassinations per year...  and the American populace is becoming less and less sympathetic collateral of those who perpetuate a corrupt status quo...  

So, as I learned as a child to simply gloss over how a black was killed in gang involvement, I learned to gloss over deaths of ""authorities"".  

And somewhere I should add a comment about inheritance of houses and generational family wealth being non-existent due to corruption...",1,2024-12-30 22:17:28,2025-01-11 04:08:38,0.90

They also only seem to post in spaces that ostensibly agree with what they're saying, and many of the things they post don't really seem to be related to what they write (like complaining about ""Authcoms"" but using a meme about Hillary Clinton, for example.). 

Every single post of theirs also seems to include an image regardless of the text content. You think there would be at least a few text-only posts here and there, especially given that they seem to be trying to foment discussion.

Also, their supplied alt-text seems to be machine-generated, though they might just be using this because it's a convenient way of writing it. But it does indicate use of software that's able to read the text from images and interpret their content, which could also be used to generate the posts themselves.

1 most of the drugs that cross the border are for American consumption

2 the cartels are harming mexico too

Trump goofs again and billions of gallons of water needed by California farmers is lost forever.

We've warned before about the danger of incompetents in high places, and Trump just lowered the bar even further.

Obviously some moron in the White House (probably Stephen Miller) said, ""Hey, I have a good idea. Why don't we drain some reservoirs in northern California and let the water run downhill to Los Angeles"" To which agent orange replied, ""Duh, sounds like a good idea to me"".

Of course, no one checked to see if the water would actually go to Los Angeles -- in fact, it won't! There are physical barriers preventing it. In order to re-route he water it will have to be pumped over great distances and at great cost; but no one thought to check. Aside from that the fires were sustained by 100 MPH winds, and no fire department in the world could stand up to that.

So, now that water, so necessary for the farmers is lost forever.

Amateurs, fools, and arrogant numbskulls do not act, they react --shoot from the hip -- and never consider the ramifications of rash acts before they blindly rush on.

If this is the way they screw up something as innocuous as water, what is happening to out nuclear arsenal?

President Donald Trump recently ordered the release of massive amounts of water from two California dams, and now local farmers are scrambling to preserve precious freshwater resources needed for dry summer months. The Los Angeles Times reported Friday that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers — acting on Trump's orders — released water from the Terminus Dam at Lake Kaweah and the Schafer Dam at Lake Success, which are both in Tulare County in the San Joaquin Valley. Whereas water was originally flowing from the Terminus Dam at 57 cubic feet per second (cfs), it's now reportedly flowing at more than 1,500 cfs. The flow from Lake Success went from 105 cfas to 990 cfs as of Friday morning.

In a post to his official X account, Trump tweeted a ""photo of beautiful water flow that I just opened in California,"" writing: ""Today, 1.6 billion gallons and, in 3 days, it will be 5.2 billion gallons."" He suggested that the water release would help officials in the Golden State fight wildfires in Southern California.

""Everybody should be happy about this long-fought Victory!"" he tweeted. ""I only wish they listened to me six years ago – There would have been no fire!""

There is more of his blithering idiocy here:

The Los Angeles Times reported Friday that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers — acting on Trump's orders — released water from the Terminus Dam at Lake Kaweah and the Schafer Dam at Lake Success, which are both in Tulare County in the San Joaquin Valley. Whereas water was originally flowing from the Terminus Dam at 57 cubic feet per second (cfs), it's now reportedly flowing at more than 1,500 cfs. The flow from Lake Success went from 105 cfas to 990 cfs as of Friday morning.

In a post to his official X account, Trump tweeted a ""photo of beautiful water flow that I just opened in California,"" writing: ""Today, 1.6 billion gallons and, in 3 days, it will be 5.2 billion gallons."" He suggested that the water release would help officials in the Golden State fight wildfires in Southern California.

""Everybody should be happy about this long-fought Victory!"" he tweeted. ""I only wish they listened to me six years ago – There would have been no fire!""

There is more of his blithering idiocy here:

Trump goofs again and billions of gallons of water needed by California farmers is lost forever.

We've warned before about the danger of incompetents in high places, and Trump just lowered the bar even further.

Obviously some moron in the White House (probably Stephen Miller) said, ""Hey, I have a good idea. Why don't we drain some reservoirs in northern California and let the water run downhill to Los Angeles"" To which agent orange replied, ""Duh, sounds like a good idea to me"".

Of course, no one checked to see if the water would actually go to Los Angeles -- in fact, it won't! There are physical barriers preventing it. In order to re-route he water it will have to be pumped over great distances and at great cost; but no one thought to check. Aside from that the fires were sustained by 100 MPH winds, and no fire department in the world could stand up to that.

So, now that water, so necessary for the farmers is lost forever.

Amateurs, fools, and arrogant numbskulls do not act, they react --shoot from the hip -- and never consider the ramifications of rash acts before they blindly rush on.

If this is the way they screw up something as innocuous as water, what is happening to out nuclear arsenal?

Kim Jong Un said it best -- dotard, and we have to live with it until we fix it with the implementation of the 25th Amendment.

AllTheLeft,top,Since the beginning,,336,332,4,The Lincoln one is not really correct. He didn't order the hanging of the Dakota 38. He pardoned several hundred men who were sentenced to death but was told by local officers in Minnesota that if there were not hangings settlers and soldiers would carry out reprisals. This is in the context of the rebellion of the Dakota against policies that were producing mass hunger and resulted in the deaths of several hundred on both sides and the displacement of thousands of people. If you read the history of this event you have to understand that Lincoln was caught between needing to keep support for the war in the mid west states and his belief that the hangings were an injustice. In the end he decided to allow 38 men to hang in the hope it would save more lives in the long run by preventing a pogrom and maintaining war support at a time when the union was losing in Virginia. You don't have to agree with him but we should approach history with a better understanding of events and their context,27,2025-03-31 15:57:23,2025-03-31 16:24:46,0.3

Believing that the Earth belongs to everyone equally as it's our Garden of Eden and a gift from God, and that Humans themselves are a reflection of this Holy Spirit, and so to destroy these things is to say ""fuck you"" to God Himself. 

Those are the groups I grew up around, so that's why I'm connecting; i'm not comparing Hasidics to Amish beyond that little similarity I see.

- Repost a social media screenshot

- Use a vague or provocative title

- When questioned in any way, be obtuse and passive-aggressive, call people fascists for using the word ""stupid"" or thinking exploitation of workers is a more pressing issue than catcalling

- At the end, **invariably** shill your discord by saying ""edit: if y'all want a space where we don't [whatever grave sin alltheleft is accused of today], check my bio""

- Despite airing your disappointment like this, keep coming back

See this report:

A former FBI informant who admitted his fabricated claims concerning President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, as well as their interactions with the Ukrainian corporation Burisma, has been sentenced to six years in jail. The court granted the prosecution's motion to hand down such a sentence on informant Alexander Smirnov.

Details: In December, Alexander Smirnov admitted that he had given false testimony to the FBI that he allegedly knew about a US$5 million bribe to the Bidens from officials of Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden was a board member. Smirnov also pleaded guilty to tax evasion.

Quote from prosecutors in their brief: ""The defendant decided in 2020 to exploit the position of trust he enjoyed with the FBI in order to provide false information about one of the candidates for President of the United States in an attempt to influence the outcome of the election.""

More details: Smirnov’s lawyers sought a shorter sentence of 4 years, arguing that Smirnov had pleaded guilty and had already experienced a ""personal downfall"" as a result of this case and its consequences for his future career.

Background:

In February 2024, Smirnov was charged with lying to an FBI supervisor for fabricating a story about Biden and his son Hunter receiving a US$5 million bribe from the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. Under the plea agreement, Smirnov agreed to admit to one count of the first charge of lying about the Bidens and three counts of tax evasion.

Smirnov's testimony was used by Republicans in the House of Representatives as evidence of Biden's corruption, based on which they initiated impeachment proceedings.

The impeachment investigation report was published in August 2024, but it never got to a vote in the House, which would have meant Biden's impeachment.

How about show people that it's possible to break away from the capitalist, imperialist, two-faced oligopoly. That there are people worth voting *for*, and that we WILL NEVER SETTLE FOR GENOCIDE.

There must be a red line somewhere. I swallowed my pride and voted for Hillary in 2016 (after working for Bernie's campaign, for fuck's sake...). I couldn't swallow voting for Biden. If I could vote tomorrow, I would vote for Claudia de la Cruz.

But it doesn't matter who I would vote for. You're not voting for me. Vote for Palestine, vote for Palestinians. Vote for the victims of genocide and imperialism and oppression and exploitation everywhere.

If genocide is not your red line, ask yourself, what is??? What ""lesser evil"" would be too great an evil for you to vote for? Are you so determined to keep the two-party system intact that you would mindlessly pull the left lever instead of the right one, even when doing so would *actively endorse an ongoing genocide perpetrated by that candidate*???

I believe earnestly this is the only moral choice in the election, even with the spectre of climate chaos already here.

AllTheLeft,controversial,A basic introduction to gender for leftists,"Gender is a social construct. That is well known, but I often don't see much discussion beyond that. Gender is a few important things.

First, it is a message. You are telling people something about yourself and with that something of how you want to be treated. Pronouns are one thing often tied up in this. Importantly, not everybody has a message they want to use this wrapper to tell, you can have a body without needing a gender.

Second, it is self-referential. How you categorize and group the aspects of yourself you are telling us about, and the relations between these groups, is often the most important part of gender. To many men, their beard is a masculine feature, yet we have bearded women as a well-known circus trope. It doesn't matter whether or not you have a beard, it matters whether you, for example, consider it as masculine or feminine or part of your gender at all. For example, a lot more men than women are colorblind, but I don't really see people considering that part of their gender. (also, he/him lesbians are a thing.)

This means two people with the same physical features can divide them up different ways and end up describing themselves with different genders. Us trans people just being ""x gender trapped in y body"" is a lie told to cis people because in this society our rights depend on their understanding.

Third, not everyone includes the same properties in their gender at all. Some people include their neurodivergence as an aspect of it, like with autigender for example. Some people don't care about how deep their voice is one way or another. The message we send with gender is personal, not universal. We each interpret existing categories in our own ways with our own needs in mind. It is important to remember that many different cultures have many different sets of genders.

Also: I'm fine with the idea that people using the power of democracy can (with the moral legitimacy of democracy) take over/expropriate whatever productive capacities capitalist property owners have built and either shut them down if they're destructive of the environment or find ways to use capacities for the good of the group. Hopefully that can start happening more as things fall apart more. But that does not seem to require the local productive capacities remain enmeshed in its current mode of production, which in many cases involves being a minor, disposable cog in a global economic system being coordinated instrumentally at a global level to achieve the interests of the people doing the coordinating.

The whole ""global"" project of modernity set itself on fire and is falling apart all around us -- circumstances are leading us (already a couple steps down the path at this point) to a different, contra-modern, decentralized kind of revolution based on people organizing into groups (mostly but not only local) that enact autonomy and find resilient ways to survive the coming climate chaos.

AllTheLeft,controversial,I wonder who stopped them,,69,48,21,"Ukraine gave up it's fucking nukes in the nineties for guaranties that UK, USA and Russian Federation will respect it's soverenity. Russia has been interfeering in Ukrainian elections since god knows when. Putin offered the prime minister of Poland to partition Ukraine into Russian and Polish parts. 
Russia has used proxies to fight a war with Ukraine since it took over Crimea in 2014. Over two years ago they started full scale invadion. How cannone negotiate peace if your invader is continously proving that it doesn't respect any international treaty? Hundreds of thousands of war refugees came to the city where I live. I used to volontueer so maybe some refugees would have a toothbrush, higine products, a place to sleep or some clothes. My dad would drive to Ukraine to bring an extra light comertial vehicle of humanitarian supplies. He was in places where the frontilnes had crossed. He would bring photos of destroyed buildings, of a house without a roof in which a mislle didn't explode. Of terrible conditions in which people live. 
News in Poland sometimes covers attacks on Ukrainian power plants, civilian infrustructure, cities, destroyed ships with grain which was ment to contribute in UN programs to fight world hunger. 

If I asked any Ukrainian refugee whether to negotiate with Russia what would they say? 

Ukraine wasn't prevented from nagotiating with Russia. Russian imperialism prevented Russia from negotiating, while Ukraine did not see a way to achive peace by negotiating for the same reason",2,2024-11-02 18:15:06,2024-11-05 08:19:05,0.7

Not really. It's progressive to fight alongside the soviet union and prevent its destruction. But that wouldn't occur to trots, who wanted to destroy the soviet union well before the war started. That is also the major reason i'm identifying OP as a trot, not out of sectarianism.

>Many so called realists will also claim that the revolutionary socialist position on the Ukraine War is “unrealistic” (funnily enough, this is the same argument levelled by reactionaries against the entirety of the socialist project).

The trot point of ""just do worker's councils"" is not really feasible on account of everyone at this front is a rightwing shithead, so yeah. I doubt that Liebknecht is a reactionary.

[Liebknecht - Militarism and Antimilitarism](https://www.marxists.org/archive/liebknecht-k/works/1907/militarism-antimilitarism/index.htm)

>Sites of imperialist war are one of the most aggressive hotspots for revolutionary events in the entire history of capitalism - in perhaps no other context is could it be more “realistic” to demand a revolutionary solution than in times of imperialist barbarism.

This is a confusion of cause and effect. Two examples (note that the article makes no examples) Russia lost the war, the revolution obviously didn't start at the frontline, and Vietnam, which was in the process of revolution which called the americans there.

>but small scale rebellions. The most dramatic of course has been the 2023 Wagner Group uprising,

Which would have totally established a soldier-and-worker council. Just like Rosa wanted.

>In terms of material conditions, soldier-worker revolution is as realistic in Ukraine and Russia as it was anywhere in Europe in 1917.

That's entirely correct, for all the wrong reasons lmao. I love trots.

>Today, revolutionary leadership is left to \[...\] the sorry hands of oligarchs like Prigozhin, dooming them to failure.

genuinely speechless. Even more irritating, the analysis that follows is spot on. Until, as a finishing touch

>Marxism \[...\] must learn to assert itself firmly and coherently behind its own framework of analysis, rather than being a mere plaything of aesthetics and Red dress up.

",0,0,0,"I think the reason it feels like, when listening to the discourse concerning trans people, that ""only cis people can fetishize trans people"" is simply because when trans people fetishize trans people it's ultimately just a personal problem. It could absolutely become a larger social problem at some point but as it stands any trans person who is spending time with trans people for fetishistic reasons is likely dealing with some personal issues. And like you noted, and bears repeating, that trans people who exclusively date other trans people are doing so more out of safety or comfort rather than any particular fetish. Meanwhile when cis people fetishize trans folks they often are explicitly denying the trans persons identity and quite often still lash out because their fetish has not gotten in the way of their transphobia whatsoever.",0,2025-09-27 14:11:44,2025-09-27 14:31:33,0.9

This is a great opportunity to advocate for leftist positions and push socialist policies into the minds of people in your community in person. You cannot help guide the movement if you're not showing up and voicing your stance. Sitting at home in isolation and complaining is worth less than any poorly effective protest. It's also exactly what they want.

Fascism seeks to isolate you, to make you slowly give up quietly to make you an easier target and unable to stand on your own. Go outside. Talk to your community. Know you're not alone even if you're not surrounded by socialists

Not showing up because it isn't aimed exactly where you want it to be and the crowd doesn't fully align with you or because you're too scared you might help the fascist is defeatist. Don't give up because you can't preach to the choir, get out there and grow the damn choir.

#### A response and application to German politics

In the video Noncompete argues that we need to organize in a party, that is not funded by the bourgoise and has a class conscious understanding of itself. In this analysis i want to see if die Linke holds up to that standard and why it still fails to be a revolutionary marxist party and for example upholds the position of liberal zionism.

#### Now to my query: ""Die Linke is not a marxist party!""

Die Linke is not a marxist party, even if it fullfills the abstract definition from Noncompetes video. This is because the definition from NonCompete is not excaustive and not attuned to German reality. Die Linke has made the crucial mistake of being dependent on the German state. Lets me illustrate this point further: Die Linke is financed through 2 prongs: its voter base/members and the state.

> According to its state mandated [finance report of December 2023](https://www.die-linke.de/fileadmin/1_Partei/finanzen/rechenschaftsbericht_aktuell/Rechenschaftsbericht_2023.pdf) the party had income of 36 Mil. in 2023 (29 Mil. in 2022, 33 Mil. in 2021 and 2020). This split:
> 
> - 9.4 Million through membership fees and 2 Million (mostly) smaller donations
>   
> - 20 Million by the state directly as party of its party financing and 6 Million from party wide agreement to donate portions of parlamentarian salaries.
>   
> 
> This comes out to roughly 30% being financed by the people. This ratio has been quite stable over the years.
> 
> This however, doesnt include [""Fraktionsfinanzierung"" (faction financing)](https://steuerzahler.de/aktion-position/politikfinanzierung/fraktionen/) another prong of state financing of the parties that are with <5% in the Bundestag. which comes out to 10,4 Million for the year 2023 (2025 with the larger amount of seats it will come out to 13.3 Million, at least)
> 
> Even then there is still the financing of a foundation with close ties to the party. This comes out at 77 Million!!! for the [year 2023](https://www.rosalux.de/fileadmin/rls_uploads/pdfs/Jahresberichte/Jahresbericht_2023.pdf), also slated to increase in 2025 due to the larger faction size (maybe another 10)

All this fiancing only works because the party works in the frame given by the state, this includes a commitment to german imperialism and the raison d' etate (Staatsräson) being not only contiuation of capitalism but also the existence of the state of Israel.

This is also the reason why, even if the party had another leadership couldnt just throw out all the antigermans and become a leninist kader party which would be in direct conflict to numerous party laws.

Same goes for The Rosa-Luxemburg-Stiftung (RLS) which has to abide by the strict foundation and association laws and is under permanent threat of being declared a threat against the common good (Gefährdung des Gemeinwohls) to secure their continued funding.",30,21,9,[removed],8,2025-02-25 12:49:14,2025-02-25 13:40:03,0.95

Your contention seems to be more radical, though: that any party participating in electoral politics cannot be truly Marxist because of the constraints placed by the state on political parties. This means that the only way to organize is through labor unions and revolutionary organizations, both of which are heavily suppressed in Germany. I fail to see how Germans can build political support for the overthrow of capitalism without an organizing force, i.e. a Marxist party. Therefore it seems to be a necessary evil that Die Linke receives state recognition. Their current stance on Israel, which as you say is mandated by German law, is unlikely to continue post-revolution, as it's not in line with their overall program. TLDR: Marxist parties in liberal-capitalist systems need to comply with laws to avoid repression, but party leaders should remember that the overthrow of capitalism cannot come through the current parliamentary system.",12,2025-02-25 12:49:14,2025-02-25 18:20:10,1.0

The existence of a religious ethno state is in such a harsh conflict that anyone supporting it has fundementally flawed assumptions that prohibit a deeper understanding of leftist thought. The current genocide is only part of the this enmity.

But back to the german Party die Linke. Yes indeed, the party has called out the artrocities committed by Israel without failing to mention the artrocities committed by Hamas. However, the party is strictly for the 2 State solution and is in violent opposition towards the one state solution (democratic, joined palestinian and jewish) which is the only peaceful solution midterm (with a abolishment of every state in the longterm).

Just as South Africa the boykott of Israel (BDS) is neccessary inorder to bring the israeli state down. Another Point die Linke is at least afraid to stand for.

My research above was to find out why die Linke still allowes for antids to be part of the party and why it hasnt seeked to rid them. **But also why it doesnt talk of class struggle more.** I think i found the material conditions that shaped this current policy and the very same conditions that will prevent the party from achieving or even talking off a revolution.",12,2025-02-25 12:49:14,2025-02-25 14:24:03,1.0

#### Now to my query: ""Die Linke is not a marxist party!""

Die Linke is not a marxist party, even if it fullfills the abstract definition from Noncompetes video. This is because the definition from NonCompete is not excaustive and not attuned to German reality. Die Linke has made the crucial mistake of being dependent on the German state. Lets me illustrate this point further: Die Linke is financed through 2 prongs: its voter base/members and the state.

> According to its state mandated [finance report of December 2023](https://www.die-linke.de/fileadmin/1_Partei/finanzen/rechenschaftsbericht_aktuell/Rechenschaftsbericht_2023.pdf) the party had income of 36 Mil. in 2023 (29 Mil. in 2022, 33 Mil. in 2021 and 2020). This split:
> 
> - 9.4 Million through membership fees and 2 Million (mostly) smaller donations
>   
> - 20 Million by the state directly as party of its party financing and 6 Million from party wide agreement to donate portions of parlamentarian salaries.
>   
> 
> This comes out to roughly 30% being financed by the people. This ratio has been quite stable over the years.
> 
> This however, doesnt include [""Fraktionsfinanzierung"" (faction financing)](https://steuerzahler.de/aktion-position/politikfinanzierung/fraktionen/) another prong of state financing of the parties that are with <5% in the Bundestag. which comes out to 10,4 Million for the year 2023 (2025 with the larger amount of seats it will come out to 13.3 Million, at least)
> 
> Even then there is still the financing of a foundation with close ties to the party. This comes out at 77 Million!!! for the [year 2023](https://www.rosalux.de/fileadmin/rls_uploads/pdfs/Jahresberichte/Jahresbericht_2023.pdf), also slated to increase in 2025 due to the larger faction size (maybe another 10)

All this fiancing only works because the party works in the frame given by the state, this includes a commitment to german imperialism and the raison d' etate (Staatsräson) being not only contiuation of capitalism but also the existence of the state of Israel.

This is also the reason why, even if the party had another leadership couldnt just throw out all the antigermans and become a leninist kader party which would be in direct conflict to numerous party laws.

Same goes for The Rosa-Luxemburg-Stiftung (RLS) which has to abide by the strict foundation and association laws and is under permanent threat of being declared a threat against the common good (Gefährdung des Gemeinwohls) to secure their continued funding.",30,21,9,"Consider also that the material circumstances have changed since Lenin's time.

Are you part of the active discourse? Do you see the kind of propaganda we have to endure day in day out? This is not an excuse, because concerning what you say I largely agree. Someone with a closed of anti-D mindset has nothing to do with leftism and there have been party exclusions for people with this mindset (atleast one I know personally). These are not the people I am concerned with however, as they are not dominant in the radical left. Much more pervasive are those who agree with you that the IDF is going too far, but who argue, that the israeli reaction after the 7th October was in some form legitimate. These are not the people who laude the USA or demand ""Atombomben auf Deutschland"". These are however the people who exclude palestine flags from demonstrations against the right, from may-demonstrations and so on, but still shout ""Hoch die internationale Solidarität"". The problem and that is the reason the PdL is not excluding them is that these people are everywhere. Without them there is no blockades of neonazis in Dresden, there are no squats, there are no unions, there is simply no organizing. I see it daily in my city (Hamburg) where a few hundred internationalists can agree upon a demonstration, but the GEW or IGM or FAU will not show up, because the pro-palestine crowd is not willing to compromise and is stupendously insisting on their position (and it might very well be the truth) that the elimination of Israel is the only way forward. The problem is that the pro pali crowd and internationalists cannot provide a good security guarantee for the sympathisants of the jewish people in Israel (and other parts of the world), which wheighs heavily, as the other side can point to countless incidents of stupid antisemitic attacks by pro-palestinians. 

If you want to stay a fringe movement, without hope to influence Germanys position on Israel, then go on and continue on the moral highground. Get kicked out of larger leftist groups, because you cannot stay civil in discussions and so on. This is not helping us however. We need to be able to form coalitions, so we can stop the state from doing stuff like [this](https://www.amnesty.de/pressmitteilung/deutschland-absage-veranstaltungen-un-sonderberichterstatterin-francesca-albanese).

Part of that is lone leftists who aspire and are on their journey and do not have a lot of theory backing their actions. Nor do these people have friends or a local community to help them gain a better understanding then falling back into reactionary liberal mindsets.

As gauche as it is to point to the Art of War, it is a fairly long held understanding one should never underestimate their enemy and when the question of when someone acts illogical or inept from a position of power, one should probably take a step and question what is the overall reasoning for that.

for half of them I think this really is the problem. their echo chambers are so focused on creating caricatures of left/liberals that they never hear a sane opinion and thus have all these strawmen in their head about what others believe/want to do, so it actually *is* rational to think we're crazy based on the information they consume. These people are convertible. It is not easy, but it is possible to reach them.

The other half though only sees the world through the lens of power. These are the guys collectively puppeteering the other half.

Many of the people who show up to his organization’s events are Jewish. Some of the most vocal supporters of Palestinian liberation are Jewish. Leftists that protest Israel are protesting the imperialistic goals of Israel and the genocide they are carrying out. 

Obviously this is anecdotal, there are extreme outliers in every group of people, but I have never met a pro-Palestine leftist who is anti-Semitic. Common media narratives, especially in western countries that support Israel, try to equate Judaism and Zionism. They use criticism of Israel as justification for silencing pro-Palestinian leftists by claiming that it’s an attack on Jewish people. 

This is an absurd claim to make when you consider that the extremist wing of conservative ideology is inherently antisemitic and consists of actual Nazis. 

In my experience, leftists are anti-genocide and anti-violence. This applies to Palestinians just as much as it does to Jews or any other group of people.

zionism is distinct from judaism. judaism is the religious belief of the jew, and can be held as a belief only by a jew. zionism is the political and ideological belief and goal of a jewish ethnostate. anyone of any background can hold this view, which is why many extreme christian evangelicals subscribe to it, despite their (oftentimes) self proclaimed antisemitism. during the genesis of zionism in the late 19th century, zionism was seen as *the* answer to ‘The Jewish Question’. hitler used deportations to what was then mandatory palestine as a way to remove jews without killing them — in this sense, hitler was a zionist, but virulently antisemitic. 

we as leftists are opposed to zionism because it espouses genocidal intent, and is predicated upon the ethnic cleansing of native inhabitants of a piece of land in service of an ethnostate. the state of israel sought to expel the native palestinians from their territories and convert the land into the so-called Promised Land as per the bible. any leftist should oppose settler-colonialism, apartheid, racism, etc. the state of israel is fundamentally an apartheid state — it has been since and before its founding and will likely never change. 

leftists also oppose (at least generally) the idea of a nation state. i as a marxist see the ethnostate in its modern inception as a key way   to legitimise the dictatorship of the jewish bourgeois, whilst the palestinian and israeli proletarians are distracted and used for their roles in endless colonial warfare.

we DO NOT want to genocide israelis. we want a one state solution, one where both palestinians and israelis are treated with equal dignity and respect. we want a solution that provides reparations for the last 80 years of colonialism. we want a right of return for the palestinian diaspora displaced over the last 80 years. we want an end to the violence in the middle east, most of which is caused by (either directly or indirectly) the state of israel — whether it be aggressive expansion, destabilising neighbours (like syria or lebanon), or countries like iran who use the plight of the oppressed palestinians as justification for imperialist war. 

the left DOES NOT ADVOCATE RESETTLEMENT. IT DOES NOT ADVOCATE GENOCIDE. we want equality and an end to imperialism.",15,2025-03-25 11:25:49,2025-03-25 16:35:21,0.95

As an upper-middle class white guy myself, it just reminds me of my worst qualities from when I was younger (mostly that I was very focused on centering myself in every issue).

At the same time, I think there’s a valid point that leftists are a bit hostile to young white men. And a lot of that comes from our adoption of some progressive liberal attitudes around language and performance. While I don’t think we need to cater to young white men, I do think we should reflect on the ways we prioritize performative allyship over organizing a unified working class. Because this doesn’t just alienate young white men, it alienates a lot of people we are trying to be allies to.

For example, things like the “progressive stack” can be alienating to a lot of people. If a white guy’s first foray into the leftist space is being told to be quiet and get in the back of the line, he’s going to feel unwelcome. Similarly, I know a lot of color who feel contempt for the white progressives that grovel around race issues (they feel tokenized, and like the white liberal is seeing them as a person of color and not an actual person).

Leftists have a message and place for all workers. We definitely should not lessen our focus on the most marginalized communities. But we can still communicate our solutions for the issues that affect young white men without abandoning other communities. I think that some messaging directed towards the issues that white guys care about (lack of economic opportunity and isolation) could help bring them into the fold.

Of course, some white guys (and it’s not limited to them) feel like they are unwelcome if their experiences are not always centered. We shouldn’t cater to that preference. But we shouldn’t let our antipathy to someone’s lack of awareness keep us from educating and developing them into good comrades. Some might reject it, and those guys should be pushed out, but others might just need a bit of guidance on how they can be good members of a diverse community.",43,2025-01-30 15:51:32,2025-01-30 19:07:00,0.6

Unsurprisingly, that type of religious-backed bootstrap mentality makes them ripe for conservative picking - my own brother was kind of falling into the hole because many of his friends were sucked into the culture war nonsense despite being in the rural South, where none of the conservative boogeymen would even show up in their day to day. But they're also being pelted from all sides by right wing nonsense and there's only so much defense your mind can do when it's coming from people around you and the algorithms for whatever apps you're using. I'm lucky that he's always asked me for my opinion on things and actually listens and engages, so I was able to pull him back and get him to think more critically and less selfishly - i don't mean to be rude but his friends are dumb and there's also an underlying, sinister current of praising shock value in younger circles that has become more mainstream so they're still stuck.


I don't have a good response for how to get these people back - it's actually sort of the million dollar question at the moment because you're having to fight external voices and media that cozy up to their own prejudices that hit them over and over with 5 second TikToks while we're over here trying to distill socialist thought into digestible tidbits while not being blocked by the algorithms and also while many comrades are trying to avoid persecution.

2. You cannot spend most of your time worrying about being right or wrong.

Like everyone else, make a solid decision and proceed until evidence in your personal life shows you otherwise. It sounds like your personal life is shouting at you to take a break. Taking a break doesn't mean not caring. It doesn't mean you are never coming back to it.

You do sound like you're struggling with some kind of obsessive moralism. However, as a former fundie in my teenage years I felt the same. Becareful that you aren't imposing guilt where none belongs.

I know of very few ethical systems that encourage the degradation and eventual impotency of someone so useful as you sound. I assure you, you will burnout. Again another personal experience from fundie days.

Final suggestion seek therapy. You can sort some of these things out with another party that is not directly involved in your daily life.

Elon Musk uses L.A. wildfires to stoke conspiracy theories and outrage

© Saul Martinez/For The Washington Post

As flames engulf large swaths of Los Angeles, Elon Musk has been inundating his 212 million followers with a stream of posts that cast blame for the blaze on Democrats and diversity policies, amplifying narratives that have taken hold among far-right activists and Republican leaders, including President-elect Donald Trump.

Musk has posted or replied to more than 80 posts about the fire, many of which pinned the devastation on liberal policies, in some cases based on false claims or racist ideas, according to a Washington Post analysis.

He downplayed the role of climate change, placing blame on individual female firefighters of color and lesbian firefighters, including posting their names and faces. Musk boosted an hour-long propaganda video by right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones that claimed the fires were “part of a larger globalist plot” to cause the collapse of the United States, replying simply, “True.” And he repeatedly amplified claims that the Los Angeles Fire Department’s investments in diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs cost lives by wasting money that could have been spent on disaster response, suggesting the destruction could have been mitigated if the department had retained more White men.

“DEI means people DIE,” Musk said on X. (The Los Angeles Fire Department did not return a request for comment.)

Musk’s use of X to stoke partisan outrage and conspiracy theories about the disaster underscores how a platform once viewed as a global hub for breaking news has transformed into a megaphone for the political views of its owner. It also shows how the billionaire, who holds no official office but is a close adviser to the president-elect, may use his unprecedented online reach to bolster the incoming administration.

Musk has seized on prominent natural disasters and other news events to promote partisan misinformation. Last year, he responded to Boeing’s safety issues and cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike’s massive global tech outage by bashing the companies’ DEI initiatives. He helped fuel right-wing conspiracy theories that complicated rescue efforts during the devastating hurricane in North Carolina.

There is more sheer madness here:

That doesn’t mean the public relations handouts but what they say to each other about what they are up to. There is quite a lot of interesting documentation.

>Those are three major sources of information about the nature of the media. You want to study them the way, say, a scientist would study some complex molecule or something. You take a look at the structure and then make some hypothesis based on the structure as to what the media product is likely to look like. Then you investigate the media product and see how well it conforms to the hypotheses. Virtually all work in media analysis is this last part—trying to study carefully just what the media product is and whether it conforms to obvious assumptions about the nature and structure of the media.

AllTheLeft,controversial,Why did Harris refuse to break from Biden?,"Hey all, 
So, I haven’t posted here, and I know this is probably a rather unorthodox post for this subreddit, but my current creative project is to take scenes from Shakespeare’s various plays and recreate the months leading up to Biden’s nightmare of a debate with Donald Trump (and the Democratic Party’s refusal to acknowledge that Biden was, at worst, suffering from cognitive decline, or, at best, simply aging too much to be able to do his job), the month of calls for him to drop out (and his refusal to do so), and then Kamala Harris’ campaign against (and loss to) Trump in the 2024 election.

Originally, it was just supposed to be an adaptation of King Lear transposed to the 2024 election, but I realized quickly that there were figures in the story (Jill and Hunter Biden, Trump, and members of Biden’s inner circle like Steve Ricchetti, Mike Donilon, Jeff Zaents, Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, etc) who don’t fit neatly into the framework of King Lear, so I started cannibalizing scenes from Shakespeare’s other plays such as the Henry VI trilogy, Richard II, Macbeth, Julius Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra, Richard III, Timon of Athens, etc to more accurately tell the story. During and after the debate, however, I’d also intersperse the Shakespearean dialogue with actual quotes from the real-life figures.

One aspect of the story that I’m trying to figure out, however, is Harris’s relationship with Biden after he’d been pressured into exiting the race. Obviously, Harris made plenty of mistakes on her own (campaigning with the Cheneys, trying to outflank Trump from the right on immigration, refusing to promise pro-Palestine activists that she’d impose an arms embargo on Israel if she was elected president, her disastrous appearance on *The View*, etc) - but it’s also clear that Biden wasn’t exactly helpful, either.

It’s tempting to write off Harris as an idiot with no political instincts. At the same time, though, what were her own feelings towards Biden as he undermined her (getting photographed wearing a MAGA cap, saying Trump’s supporters were garbage, etc)? Why did she refuse to break from his policy positions that were clearly very deeply unpopular?

I’ve been reading various books on the 2024 election, including Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson’s *Original Sin* (which I finished reading in a little under a day), *Fight: Inside the Wildest Race for the White House*, and *Uncharted*, and they all have differing reasons as to why Harris acted the way she did. Tapper and Thompson claim that Harris was aware of the implications of a female subordinate (and a woman of color, no less) breaking with her male superior and was afraid of looking disloyal, and that she chose to stop making public campaign appearances with Biden after the MAGA cap incident. *Fight* and *Uncharted*, however, say that Biden told her that there couldn’t be any difference between their positions, or that Harris did what she did out of a genuine sense of loyalty and gratitude to Biden (she’d accused him of being a segregationist in a debate and her 2020 campaign crashed and burned before the primaries even began - and he’d still made her his VP pick anyway).

So, what do y’all think? Did Harris refuse to break with Biden because

A.) she genuinely agreed with Biden and felt loyal and grateful to him

B.) she was afraid of looking disloyal to her boss

C.) Biden demanded absolute loyalty from her, so she really didn’t have a choice

D.) all of the above

E.) some other reason that I’m forgetting / not thinking of

If there were to be a scene that showed the fallout of the MAGA cap incident, for example, would it be more accurate to show Harris confronting Biden at a campaign headquarters, screaming at him in rage and verbally tearing him a new one before telling him to just stay out of it? Or would she be more likely to privately vent to her closest advisors and passively / quietly cancel appearances with him?

Thanks in advance!",7,5,2,"There’s another reason you aren’t taking into consideration and that’s that Harris maintained unpopular positions for the same reason Biden adopted them in the first place and that is because they were popular with the donors. There is a pervasive attitude within the Democratic Party that they do not actually need to appeal to voters, they only need to demonstrate that the GOP is worse and therefore it is a valid political calculation to court the donors, dress it up as appealing to moderate voters, and then completely ignore their own base. The argument being that they *need* that sweet, sweet donor cash in order to be competitive, in order to fund their operations against the Republicans, and that if they were ever to fully embrace the sorts of things that the base wants then they would face an insurmountable amount of cash being spent against them. Then there’s also the matter of loyalty to those same donors who’ve helped them in the past to get into positions where they can run for President or other higher positions. Loyalty they don’t extend to their own base, because where else is the base going to go? Or at least that’s the reasoning because apparently these people still cannot fathom the idea that the base will go exactly nowhere, not even to the polls when they need them.",20,2025-10-05 21:24:35,2025-10-05 23:47:28,0.6

I think that if you stay 1h-1h30 and participate in the protest and interact with some of the people that are there you have done enough. Not everyone can stay during all of the protest, and you can try and understand which ones are easier for you. For example, one of the last actions I took was defending a bookshop against some nazis, and this ended up with me and my comrades getting pushed and beaten up by the cops, as well as the nazis yelling at us. TAll of the noise this made was easier to deal with in the moment because i was focused on not getting hurt, on protecting my friends and trying to understand what the cops would do next. Afterwards I was absolutely overwhelmed and exhausted, but not as much as I was in/after the feminist march or on the worker's day in may.

AllTheLeft,controversial,Looking for practical reasons to arm myself as a leftist.,"A very common view in leftist communities is that guns in the arms of working class and oppressed people is important. A lot of people cite the Marx quote “under no pretext”. 

I’m starting to get into guns lately. I plan to take a safety course, get registered, and then spend some time at a range with rentals to figure out what I like shooting.

I’m curious though when it comes to actually owning a gun. The first thing to think about when buying a gun is what do you plan to use it for? I actually can’t think of an answer for myself.


 In terms of home defense: I don’t think that my property is worth someone else’s life if they were to break into my home to steal stuff. However, if they were in there to harm me or my family, I would not hesitate to use the gun. But then storage comes into play. I would definitely want the gun locked up where it will be the least likely to present danger in terms of negligent discharges or falling into the wrong hands. My wife and I plan to have children eventually, and I wouldn’t want a gun anywhere near my kids. But at the same time, a locked-up and hidden gun is basically worthless in terms of home defense. If someone is in my house approaching with intent to harm, no way in hell am I gonna have time to open a safe, pull out the gun, load it, turn off the safety, etc. Plus, what are the odds of someone breaking into my home to do me harm, rather than just grab my TV and get out quickly?


In terms of concealed carry: I feel like this is the most likely case I’d ever need to use it. Especially since my wife is Jewish, and many of my friends and loved ones are part of the queer community and/or PoC. If someone thought it fit to harm them due to their prejudices, I don’t wanna take chances with anything less than lethal. If someone were to follow or attempt to SA any women in my life, I’d use lethal force. But that opens up an entire can of worms in the form of legal troubles if I shoot somebody. It also puts my loved ones at risk. If someone were to grab them or attack them at close range, the gun would be useless since taking a shot could risk hitting them. Hell, I consider my dogs family. But dognappings are unfortunately way too common, and I wouldn’t hesitate to use a gun if someone were to try and take my dog. But I don’t know if the law would see that as self defense since dogs are legally property, and I could go to prison.


I know it would be useful for left wing groups to be just as armed as right wing. So I know that my gun ownership could help with that, but idk if I’d want people knowing I’m a gun owner. It seems risky to be throwing that info around willy nilly.

I don’t think a gun would be useful to protect myself against a tyrannical government. I doubt a small handgun would do much against bombs or drones and shit.


I do love camping and hiking, so I definitely think having a gun if I’m camping in a remote area would be helpful. If nothing else, just for peace of mind, knowing it could serve as protection against wildlife or sketchy individuals. 

Other than that, I’m still on the fence whether I’d want to own something with defense in mind, or just buy whatever .22 is fun to shoot with affordable ammo and use it for the sole purpose of dicking around at the range.


All in all, what do you guys think is the best reason for gun ownership from a leftist perspective? If you own one, why do you own it, and what cases do you see yourself ever needing to use it?

If someone is in my house approaching with intent to harm, no way in hell am I gonna have time to open a safe, pull out the gun, load it, turn off the safety, etc. Plus, what are the odds of someone breaking into my home to do me harm, rather than just grab my TV and get out quickly?


In terms of concealed carry: I feel like this is the most likely case I’d ever need to use it. Especially since my wife is Jewish, and many of my friends and loved ones are part of the queer community and/or PoC. If someone thought it fit to harm them due to their prejudices, I don’t wanna take chances with anything less than lethal. If someone were to follow or attempt to SA any women in my life, I’d use lethal force. But that opens up an entire can of worms in the form of legal troubles if I shoot somebody. It also puts my loved ones at risk. If someone were to grab them or attack them at close range, the gun would be useless since taking a shot could risk hitting them. Hell, I consider my dogs family. But dognappings are unfortunately way too common, and I wouldn’t hesitate to use a gun if someone were to try and take my dog. But I don’t know if the law would see that as self defense since dogs are legally property, and I could go to prison.


I know it would be useful for left wing groups to be just as armed as right wing. So I know that my gun ownership could help with that, but idk if I’d want people knowing I’m a gun owner. It seems risky to be throwing that info around willy nilly.

I don’t think a gun would be useful to protect myself against a tyrannical government. I doubt a small handgun would do much against bombs or drones and shit.


I do love camping and hiking, so I definitely think having a gun if I’m camping in a remote area would be helpful. If nothing else, just for peace of mind, knowing it could serve as protection against wildlife or sketchy individuals. 

Other than that, I’m still on the fence whether I’d want to own something with defense in mind, or just buy whatever .22 is fun to shoot with affordable ammo and use it for the sole purpose of dicking around at the range.


All in all, what do you guys think is the best reason for gun ownership from a leftist perspective? If you own one, why do you own it, and what cases do you see yourself ever needing to use it?

",8,5,3,"I have a glock 19. It came with 2 x15 shot magazines and while there was a gap in fascist california’s restrictions, i ordered and received a 29 and 32 round magazines. I have it to protect my body, my dog and my stuff. As far as I’m concerned, my tv or one of my guitars is worth more than the kind of “person” that thinks its ok for them to violate my space. I think once you violate someone’s space, you deserve whatever that person’s reaction is. There is no reason that one should have to wait to determine a trespasser’s intentions. Doing so creates even more of a disadvantage. This cones from my experience on friends ranch where, despite orange “ no tress passing / no hunting” signs almost every 10’ along the property line, hunters shot through their space anyway. One time they returned from town to find the kitchen chair that either of the 2 brothers sat in, split in half from a hunter’s bullet.  When we saw hunters on their land we confronted and ejected them from the property - armed to the the teeth. My point is that even the trespassers intent doesn’t matter. They are not supposed to be there, and deserve whatever they get for violating someone else’s space.  Now, an AK or AR weapon, while actually being what the 2nd amendment, to me is for (having arms to overthrow or resist the government), I don’t see how shooting someone across the street is defending your space. As far as having high capacity magazines, it can make up for not being the best shot as well as multiple aggressors. I don’t mess with other people and see no reason why I should have to tolerate other people messing with me.",1,2024-11-12 05:46:46,2024-11-15 18:00:27,-0.90

But you can tell commies this and they'll repeat the same line like a broken record: ""it wasn't real communism""


At what point will they understand that real communism is humanly impossible? At what point will they realize that human nature is selfish, lazy, and easily corruptible? When will they realize that people won't work without some profit to themselves? When will they realize that if you give a few people total control the government, industry, and economy it's not going to end well?

Conservative,hot,Top Trump Prosecutor Defies Bush-Appointed Judge Who Ruled He Can’t Do His Job,,20,15,5,"The article doesn't include any explanation by the court of its conclusion that he was unlawfully serving, but apparently the thinking was that the ""acting"" appointment power only kicks in should the previous US attorney die or resign during their appointment.  

I don't think anyone who has been watching politics will fail to recognize the behind-the-scenes hallmark of some RINO shenanigans in the lack of a traditional nomination and confirmation process, as with a Senate majority, there \*shouldn't\* be an issue.  If I was guessing, my safe assumption would be that its Susan Collins (RINO) and/or Lisa Murkowski (RINO) who are responsible - that they had communicated to the Trump administration that they'd withhold their vote, thereby making a confirmation impossible.",1,2025-10-29 17:06:38,2025-10-29 17:34:06,-0.85

Conservative,hot,Five Republican Senators Join Democrats to Block Trump’s Tariffs on Brazil,,315,252,63,"McConnell and Tillis are pre-MAGA, chamber-of-commerce type Republicans and on their way out, they don't give a shit anymore. Collins is up for reelection in a state Harris won by 7 points, she has to cast votes like this to pad her bipartisan credentials and ensure her political survival, so she gets a pass. Rand Paul comes from a place of genuine ideological conviction. 

So taking context into consideration, Murkowski is once again the biggest disappointment. At this point, I have no doubt that she would switch parties if Democrats end up one seat away from retaking the Senate after 2026...",1,2025-10-29 02:19:39,2025-10-29 08:20:55,0.6
