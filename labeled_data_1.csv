>But we can’t cut funding for health and development—programs that help people stay resilient in the face of climate change—to do it.

He retired a few years ago and the club dissolved (it was a big lift and, to be honest, a lot of parents went off the rails when their worldview was being questioned by their teens who seemed to know more about basic civics than them). No one wanted to be the next target.

there's not any talk about if this actually even happened, it's just kinda implicitly suggested that it did. Which makes me think that it probably didn't happen.

We should be super wary of the Chinese government and all its subsidiaries, because every company in China is beholden to and dependent on the government to exist.",1,2025-10-28 17:04:37,2025-10-29 06:28:36,-0.5

I don’t know about you? 

But I am sick and tired of all of the negativity he throws out.

HE intentionally shuts the door on the USA.

Every. Single. Day.

And?

Did you see the image he posted of himself flying a plane over the USA?

■ Actually emptying loads of crap on the blue states he abhors? 

■ Wearing a crown on his head?

A single day after the peaceful ""No Kings"" protests?

Please...

It truly shows that our current POTUS:

■ does not care; and

■ could really care less who knows about his disdain for Americans - every single one of us.

It certainly shows he did not listen to all of the peaceful protests that told him what we need.

What additional proof do you need?

We need affordable housing, food, insurance, and medical care/medication. 

He has systematically destroyed all programs that aimed to help people.

Sit down and think about that.

A disagreement regarding these issues led to our government shutting down.

Regarding the destruction of the people's house - our White House that he is supposed to be occupying temporarily? 

Why?

We DO NOT need a ballroom.

The White House is being renovated as if it were his personal home - forever.

It's the White House. 

Not Trump's House.

How can he take money for these renovations, and not support Americans who rely on all of the programs he destroyed?

What happens in November, as has been claimed, when the SNAP program can't make a payment?

>*In just over a week, nearly 42 million people in the U.S. who get federal food assistance are in danger of seeing their benefits disappear because of the ongoing federal shutdown.*

Numerous experts from throughout our Nation have voiced concerns.

>*""The vast majority are children, working people, older Americans, veterans and people with disabilities,"" Joel Berg, CEO of Hunger Free America, says of food stamp recipients. ""If the SNAP program shuts down, we will have the most mass hunger suffering we've had in America since the Great Depression.""*

His actions and words speak volumes, IMO..

“The analysis identifies five interrelated trends driving this process. Executive overreach is being consolidated through governance by decree and weaponization of the state, combining sweeping executive orders and expansive emergency claims with politicized control of the civil service and oversight bodies, the targeting of perceived opponents via justice and intelligence functions, and preferential protection of allies. Erosion of judicial independence has advanced not only through partisan appointments, but through strategic reliance on the Supreme Court’s “shadow docket,” efforts to curtail judicial remedies and intimidate the legal profession, and selective compliance with court rulings. Legislative weakness and abdication have diminished Congress’s capacity to serve as a coequal branch, as delegation, obstruction, and polarization undermine effective oversight. The electoral system is being reshaped not only through structural biases like gerrymandering and voting restrictions, but through partisan control of administration, intimidation of election officials, and efforts to contest certified results—undermining the expectation that elections will be fairly run and their outcomes accepted. Finally, the undermining of public trust, knowledge, and civil society through attacks on the press, academia, watchdog institutions, and dissenting voices has weakened democratic culture and civic resilience.

Together, these trends indicate a restructuring of the constitutional order around personal loyalty rather than adherence to law. Data from international indices—including V-Dem, Freedom House, and Bright Line Watch—corroborate measurable declines in rule of law, checks and balances, and tolerance for pluralism.

Absent organized resistance by institutions, civil society, and the public, the United States is likely to continue along a path of accelerating democratic erosion, risking further consolidation of executive dominance and a loss of credibility as a model of democracy abroad.”",5,2025-10-17 14:06:08,2025-10-17 14:38:20,0.8

",60,46,14,"This is what I've come to recognize:

Conservatives are made up of people who have simply shut their brains off at a certain point in their life. Anything that changes after that short-circuits them. And that's all it is. They hate CHANGE. They don't spend any time examining why a thing changed (when history has proven that, when something like a human rights decision, or the recognition of someone or an event evolves, it is almost ALWAYS for the better, because we LEARN more and continue to EXPAND our morality and values). They just know, ""my brain has to change something"" and THEY HATE IT. It's why you'll hear the most ridiculous excuses/justifications for why they won't participate.

My best example of this is inclusive language, specifically pronouns. The most common ""reason"" is ""you can't compel my speech."" Just the fucking dumbest phrase ever. What's worse is, there are plainly dozens of examples of times when they do it otherwise, a great example being a woman's married name. ""Hey, can you call me this now?"" = ""yup, sure! even though I called you the other name for probably 20-30 years, no problem!!"" But they can't be ""compelled"" for trans folks? The issue isn't ""compelling speech,"" it's that their brains stopped learning before trans people and inclusive language became a commonplace topic. And they don't want to learn it. Their brains are off.

This holiday is another great example. They don't want to change, they know it as ""Columbus Day"" and simply can't be bothered to adapt their brain. Yes, A LOT of their inertia is rooted in racism, but that's just because our country is rooted in racism. I actually don't believe that their personal racism is the strongest influence.

",87,80,7,"“We are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be,” Kevin Roberts, head of the Heritage Foundation, in a public statement.

I have 40,000 or so hours paid large-scale political organizing across 20 states. My 2020 project results in AZ and NV were greater than Trump's margins of loss. Without my projects, Trump may have won those states.

I wish you were right, but you aren't. You are falling prey to normalcy bias: normal is dead. Trump is a figurehead, the minds and wills behind Project 2025 and its kindred initiatives have been plotting this since before Trump ever ran for office.

They have spent generations, since the time of Nixon's debacle, laying the groundwork and instilling workarounds to subvert legitimate authority. They're not passing legislation, because they don't need to. 

Their end goal is a christo-fascist state that does not operate under the status quo of representative democracy. They do not care if the economy is bad, they do not care if tourism is down, they do not care in foreign investment dries up, etc.

Because they are sure that they will remain on top of the pyramid. However bad things get for the rungs beneath them on the ladder, they consider it irrelevant. They're perfectly fine with 90 to 95% of the people in this country living in a dystopia. 

Because they don't think they will be among the ""have-nots"", they believe they will be among the ""haves"". And they will not be disabused of that notion until it is far too late for any of the mechanisms or institutions of the American government, or economy, to recover. 

There is no end to this without armed conflict on a mass scale. These far right groups have combined their efforts toward a common goal: the installation of ethno-Christian based authoritarianism in the United States. And they have no problem killing whoever they need to achieve it.

>That all being said, this current period we live in I believe will pass and the pessimistic nature of people claiming that the country will be ruined ""forever"" is certainly not a reality. 

I don't think anyone literally believes it is ""forever"". The point is we each only get 100 years on this earth, should we be so lucky, and the damage being done is effectively ""forever"" for anyone over the age of 30. If you're 30-50, you might see things get back to the quality of life and political stability levels of the 90s and early 00s by the time you're 50-70. If you live that long, and hopefully you've saved enough wealth in that time so you don't need to keep working through the good times. If you're 50+, this is it: it's all downhill from here for the rest of your life, unless things *drastically* change in the next <18 months.

It's also important to remember that not even China was around 1,000 years ago, not as it is today. They've been colonizers, been colonized themselves, and had who knows how many revolutions and coups. Europe isn't much different, with entire empires coming and going. So while the cities will remain and adapt to the changing times, countries and borders change. But larger, unified nations with shared identies are the most stable; no one should wish for balkanization or minimize the chances and risks that it poses.",6,2025-10-09 11:08:11,2025-10-09 19:56:09,0.6

",87,80,7,"Yes, this too shall pass. I know that. And everything seems to happen faster now, so the chance of having The US under the control of fascism for decades (Chile had Pinochet for THIRTY YEARS!) is slim. But, what if it’s fifteen years? Or ten? Or five? Many people will lose their homes, their livelihoods (there has never been, in the history of the world, a dictator that was good for the working class or the middle class) or their lives. No, I don’t believe our country will be ruined “forever”, but we are in for a very difficult few years at the very least. I have been, in my life, a very patriotic person and seeing the ruin of the progress that we had made as a country (despite all the terrible things The US has done, we also sometimes led the world in achieving rights and prosperity for all citizens) is shaming and painful, not to mention the grief of losing the personal prosperity I have worked so hard for all my life.

The only thing that gives me pause about how the future might pan out, per their theory, is the sudden breakthroughs in AI (which will be accelerated by quantum computing). I just think AI will rewrite the rulebook for everything (literally and figuratively). It’s difficult to imagine a future ten plus years from now that doesn’t include massive unemployment.

Liberal,hot,In the Defense of Truth,"And, no, I'm not talking about (un)Truth Social.

So, as background, a pretty widely followed liberal account on Twitter (fuck you, Elon) posted a tiktok video (from a different creator) about a recent incident involving ICE.  The narrative of said tiktok contained information from legitimate media sources, but used a picture that was in no way related to said events.

How did I know the picture was unrelated? I had seen the video that the picture came from a little more than a year ago and it was completely innocuous and kind of wholesome. 

Now, knowing this, I let the Twitter influencer know, very politely, that the story and the picture attributed to it were, indeed,  unrelated and she should take it down. At best, it's not a good look. At worst, it's disinformation. 

For my troubles, she doubled down, called me a liar and a bot, and blocked me before I could explain the problem in detail.

Fine. 

Whatever.

I,  then, went to the Tiktok page of the video creator (with 209k followers). He had, apparently, already been alerted to the true provenance of the picture and made an update video confirming that was not taken at the ICE incident in question. 

However, in the same update, he admitted that he got the picture from a lazy Google search,  but defended using the picture since it fit the narrative.

I found his Twitter profile which contained a tweet reiterating his defense. I responded with a reply explaining why that is intellectually dishonest. He deleted his tweet rather than engage with me.

A few things I want to point out about this.

Republicans had the votes for a budget reconciliation, but this would not have allowed them to include a lot of non-budgetary riders that they were trying to attach to the budget.

This indicates that the riders are more important to them than actually passing a budget or that they intentionally included them as poison pills for the budget to ensure that it would not pass.

Republicans were no showing meetings that were meant to come to a compromise on the budget.

This indicates that they had no real intention of avoiding a shutdown.

Republicans didn't even show up to Congress tonight to try to work out a solution or pass a continuing resolution.  As a group, they chose to not show up to work and address this pressing issue.

This indicates that they had no real intention of avoiding a shutdown.

The Republican Senate Majority leader has even been threatening that Republicans will not negotiate at all in the event of a shutdown, which shows they have no real intention of honestly resolving the shutdown.

Just a couple years ago at this time, Republicans almost forced another shutdown to occur because they refused to honor an agreement on the budget that they had made just a few months prior.  When their current speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, agreed to work with Democrats to pass a continuing resolution, Republicans became outraged and removed him as speaker of the house.

They removed their own speaker of the house because he did not follow through and force the government into a shutdown in bad faith. The current Republican speaker of the House was the eventual chosen replacement for McCarthy.  They felt he was more in line with what they wanted.

This indicates that current Republicans in Congress have a history of attempting to force the government into shutdown for bad faith reasons.

Republicans wanted this shutdown and did literally nothing to avoid it.  They forced it by putting a poison pill into the budget bill that would have revoked health care from millions of Americans and would have driven the insurance premiums up for millions more.  They did this with the intention that it would force Democrats to oppose the bill.

Republicans wanted this shutdown. They did everything possible to work for it.",46,2025-10-02 14:04:22,2025-10-02 14:56:48,0.9

The entire system is predicated on a large group with many younger, healthy individuals contributing to offset the higher expenses of the sickest people. Withdrawing federal premium contributions essentially causes the entire system to implode.  Hospitals would close when providing mandated emergency care to the uninsured  became unsustainable.

Liberal,hot,You’re Comparing Trump to the Wrong Fascist Dictator,,162,153,9,"To me Hitler is more apt just from the standpoint of his rise and method for gaining power. Franco was a general who waged a devastating civil war to obtain his control. 

Hitler and Mussolini obtained their power democratically even if they often relied on voter intimidation and street tactics. I don't think Trump is going to start building execution camps, but I do think the ways he is exerting power are hallmarks of authoritarianism seen in fascist germany and Italy. In the liberal order, rule of law and respect for institutions is very important. We have to be able to trust the system to adjudicate. We have to be able to trust that when a court order is given, it will be obeyed. The court has no army, but it holds power as long as we have faith in that system. 

An authoritarian like Trump or Hitler or Mussolini or Franco or Putin has a different understanding of power. Anything you can reach out and take with your own two hands is yours. Power only means something if you can actually exert it. The means for consolidating control are simple. There are three pillars the authoritarian needs to maintain control. He needs the police, the military, and then sizable support from the public. He doesn't need the judiciary or the legislative branches as anything more than window dressing Through propaganda he will attempt to obscure his weaknesses. He floods the masses with misinformation and lies. This isnt done because he expects you to believe him, but because he wants you to not believe anything. 

All this to say, I'm feeling pretty negative guys. This jackass winning the popular vote has made me pretty disappointed in this country and where it's going. We took the liberal world order of the 20th century for granted. When you account for the leftists as well I think it's possible to say that a majority of voting age adults in this country either don't want a liberal democracy or don't care if we are a liberal democracy.",61,2025-09-29 13:37:43,2025-09-29 13:57:58,0.9

How can people not understand that trying to cling to the phrasings of a dozen men who don't have the same knowledge as your average high schooler today, who had no issue considering black people and women less than fully entitled human beings, may have fucked it up a little?

Any person can do anything they want as long as it doesn't cause harm upon another. Unwanted action upon another's body or property is harm. And, yes, words can absolutely cause harm. We acknowledge this today all the time (e.g., Michele Carter, convicted for WORDS toward her bf to commit su\*cide). It may take a rational, reasoned investigation to determine if some particular words did, in fact, proximately cause an act, but it is ludicrous to pretend it's not possible.

In general, the law considers all speech free speech. Even hate speech is protected until it creates a clear, nearly imminent danger to someone specifically. And many court cases have shown any general language will be dropped.

The Michele Carter case resulted in conviction because of its specificity and clear direction/manipulation. The important part here then his speech is different than words. Speech is your right to say something to the general public without the government disallowing you from saying it. It’s the foundation.

This is just false. Even where I work, public school, some harmful speech is protected. And we aren't even governed by free speech the same way the rest of the country is.

Bad take and the caps lock doesn't help. Yes, people like CK using their fame to spread ignorance is a downside of free speech, but free speech is still protected.

>Imagine dedicating your life to the pursuit of a government granting its citizens the right to harm other people in any way

i mean, there's got to be a line drawn somewhere. If we give up all our freedoms in the name of maximum safety, we won't be very free. There's a balance to be found, and i don't agree with your side of it.

How can people not understand that trying to cling to the phrasings of a dozen men who don't have the same knowledge as your average high schooler today, who had no issue considering black people and women less than fully entitled human beings, may have fucked it up a little? I could rewrite the entirety of the principles in the Constitution in about one short paragraph.

Any person can do anything they want as long as it doesn't cause harm upon another. Unwanted action upon another's body or property is harm. And, yes, words can absolutely cause harm. We acknowledge this today all the time (e.g., Michele Carter, convicted for WORDS toward her bf to commit su\*cide). It may take a rational, reasoned investigation to determine if some particular words did, in fact, proximately cause an act, but it is ludicrous to pretend it's not possible.

The only difficulty arises when people who KNOW THEY'RE SAYING HARMFUL THINGS want to squeeze their words into some ""protected"" sliver of space. This is what MAGA does with Shitler and Kirk's (and many more) BLATANT stochastic terrorism. They KNOW it's violent, they KNOW their followers will do the deeds, they WANT them to do the deeds...but ""oh, hey, that's protected!!!""

Liberal,hot,Realistic chances of defeating fascism in the next 10 years,"Let me preface this by saying that I am not an expert, I know we can't predict the future, and I'm not advocating for giving up.  I will never stop fighting for freedom in our country and I hope that everyone else will do the same.  However, I'm getting worried and I'm just thinking through some details that I want to have a discussion about.

First, we know that the fascists will not leave on their own, so they will have to be forced out in some way.  Let's talk about the types of pressure that can help force them.  I think these could be the main factors.

* Mass public outcry
* Pushback from large companies
* Judiciary
* States Governors
* International pressure

None of these factors can do it on their own.  We'll need a strong and sustained response from multiple levels to have any chance of defeating fascism.

On the public outcry, that definitely exists.  The media hasn't covered it very well and just based on my personal experience, it seems to be fading.

Large companies are bowing down left and right.  Even most media companies.  I know there is some pushback but it's not a strong response right now.

Judiciary has proven they are on the side of the fascists and will enable them going forward.

I think we are seeing a strong response from some Dem Governors.  Unfortunately, Republicans control most of the state's Governors and legislatures so even if all the Dem Governors push back as hard as possible, I'm not sure that will be enough.

International pressure could come in many forms ranging from economic pressure to outright war.  By the time we get to pressure from this area, it will be catastrophic for us and the world.

  
Like I said, we need a strong and sustained response to defeat fascism, and I think at least 3 of those factors need to be involved.  Right now, I can't say that any of those factors are pushing back hard enough and that scares me.

But let's say that something changes and there is a strong response from 3 factors before the 2026 midterms.  In that case, maybe our chance of escaping fascism is 25 to 50% if I'm being optimistic.

If the strong response doesn't come until before the 2028 general election, the chances are maybe 10%.

After 2028, I don't see how we could escape fascism in the next 10 years.  That doesn't mean that we wouldn't escape it in 11 years or so.  It's hard to say what would happen in more than 10 years.  But I do know that once fascism is fully locked in, it's going to take some kind of catastrophic event to get us out.  The longer we wait to have a strong response, the more difficult it will be.

The big issue today is Gavin Newsom. He has problems with LGBTQ+ people and that’s bad. But! The political process works on him, because he’s not inhuman. Barak Obama said “my opinions are evolving” on LGBTQ+ people. And they did. 

That happened because of political pressure. And it happened after he was elected. We cannot stay home, we have to vote for the Democrat, every time, no matter who. And help them evolve. 

If liberals continue to stay home, and wait for the candidate who is just right, we could lose the entire country to a minority wing of a minority party. And they are not at all worried about taking our vote away permanently.

Liberal,hot,Realistic chances of defeating fascism in the next 10 years,"Let me preface this by saying that I am not an expert, I know we can't predict the future, and I'm not advocating for giving up.  I will never stop fighting for freedom in our country and I hope that everyone else will do the same.  However, I'm getting worried and I'm just thinking through some details that I want to have a discussion about.

First, we know that the fascists will not leave on their own, so they will have to be forced out in some way.  Let's talk about the types of pressure that can help force them.  I think these could be the main factors.

* Mass public outcry
* Pushback from large companies
* Judiciary
* States Governors
* International pressure

None of these factors can do it on their own.  We'll need a strong and sustained response from multiple levels to have any chance of defeating fascism.

On the public outcry, that definitely exists.  The media hasn't covered it very well and just based on my personal experience, it seems to be fading.

Large companies are bowing down left and right.  Even most media companies.  I know there is some pushback but it's not a strong response right now.

Judiciary has proven they are on the side of the fascists and will enable them going forward.

I think we are seeing a strong response from some Dem Governors.  Unfortunately, Republicans control most of the state's Governors and legislatures so even if all the Dem Governors push back as hard as possible, I'm not sure that will be enough.

International pressure could come in many forms ranging from economic pressure to outright war.  By the time we get to pressure from this area, it will be catastrophic for us and the world.

  
Like I said, we need a strong and sustained response to defeat fascism, and I think at least 3 of those factors need to be involved.  Right now, I can't say that any of those factors are pushing back hard enough and that scares me.

But let's say that something changes and there is a strong response from 3 factors before the 2026 midterms.  In that case, maybe our chance of escaping fascism is 25 to 50% if I'm being optimistic.

If the strong response doesn't come until before the 2028 general election, the chances are maybe 10%.

After 2028, I don't see how we could escape fascism in the next 10 years.  That doesn't mean that we wouldn't escape it in 11 years or so.  It's hard to say what would happen in more than 10 years.  But I do know that once fascism is fully locked in, it's going to take some kind of catastrophic event to get us out.  The longer we wait to have a strong response, the more difficult it will be.

What do you think about our realistic chances of escaping fascism?",76,56,20,"Conservatives have painted themselves into a corner with Trump. I don’t think the Project 2025 creators expected that there would be a Trump cult of personality. They are taking advantage of it but they didn’t expect it in my opinion. 

I honestly think Trump doesn’t want a successor to the crown. He doesn’t seem to be grooming anyone to eventually replace him. I also think no one has the personality to hold MAGA together. Right now Trump will be the puppet master for the next leader of MAGA. 

The other thing is MAGA doesn’t have a single ideology. You have a confederation of White Nationalists, Christian fundamentalists and political conservatives.",4,2025-09-26 12:33:20,2025-09-27 00:59:27,0.9

*****
""I'm a liberal, but that doesn't mean what a lot of you apparently think it does. Let's break it down, shall we? Because quite frankly, I'm getting a little tired of being told what I believe and what I stand for. Spoiler alert: not every liberal is the same, though the majority of liberals I know think along roughly these same lines:

1. I believe a country should take care of its weakest members. A country cannot call itself civilized when its children, disabled, sick, and elderly are neglected. PERIOD.

2. I believe healthcare is a right, not a privilege. Somehow that's interpreted as ""I believe Obamacare is the end-all, be-all."" This is not the case. I'm fully aware that the ACA has problems, that a national healthcare system would require everyone to chip in, and that it's impossible to create one that is devoid of flaws, but I have yet to hear an argument against it that makes ""let people die because they can't afford healthcare"" a better alternative. I believe healthcare should be far cheaper than it is, and that everyone should have access to it. And no, I'm not opposed to paying higher taxes in the name of making that happen.

3. I believe education should be affordable. It doesn't necessarily have to be free (though it works in other countries so I'm mystified as to why it can't work in the US), but at the end of the day, there is no excuse for students graduating college saddled with five- or six-figure debt.

4. I don't believe your money should be taken from you and given to people who don't want to work. I have literally never encountered anyone who believes this. Ever. I just have a massive moral problem with a society where a handful of people can possess the majority of the wealth while there are people literally starving to death, freezing to death, or dying because they can't afford to go to the doctor. Fair wages, lower housing costs, universal healthcare, affordable education, and the wealthy actually paying their share would go a long way toward alleviating this. Somehow believing that makes me a communist.

5. I don't throw around ""I'm willing to pay higher taxes"" lightly. If I'm suggesting something that involves paying more, well, it's because I'm fine with paying my share as long as it's actually going to something besides lining corporate pockets or bombing other countries while Americans die without healthcare.

6. I believe companies should be required to pay their employees a decent, livable wage. Somehow this is always interpreted as me wanting burger flippers to be able to afford a penthouse apartment and a Mercedes. What it actually means is that no one should have to work three full-time jobs just to keep their head above water. Restaurant servers should not have to rely on tips, multibillion-dollar companies should not have employees on food stamps, workers shouldn't have to work themselves into the ground just to barely make ends meet, and minimum wage should be enough for someone to work 40 hours and live.

7. I am not anti-Christian. I have no desire to stop Christians from being Christians, to close churches, to ban the Bible, to forbid prayer in school, etc. (BTW, prayer in school is NOT illegal; *compulsory* prayer in school is - and should be - illegal). All I ask is that Christians recognize *my* right to live according to *my* beliefs. When I get pissed off that a politician is trying to legislate Scripture into law, I'm not ""offended by Christianity"" -- I'm offended that you're trying to force me to live by your religion's rules. You know how you get really upset at the thought of Muslims imposing Sharia law on you? That's how I feel about Christians trying to impose biblical law on me. Be a Christian. Do your thing. Just don't force it on me or mine.

8. I don't believe LGBT people should have more rights than you. I just believe they should have the *same* rights as you.

9. I don't believe illegal immigrants should come to America and have the world at their feet, especially since THIS ISN'T WHAT THEY DO (spoiler: undocumented immigrants are ineligible for all those programs they're supposed to be abusing, and if they're ""stealing"" your job it's because your employer is hiring illegally). I believe there are far more humane ways to handle undocumented immigration than our current practices (i.e., detaining children, splitting up families, ending DACA, etc).

10. I don't believe the government should regulate everything, but since greed is such a driving force in our country, we NEED regulations to prevent cut corners, environmental destruction, tainted food/water, unsafe materials in consumable goods or medical equipment, etc. It's not that I want the government's hands in everything -- I just don't trust people trying to make money to ensure that their products/practices/etc. are actually SAFE. Is the government devoid of shadiness? Of course not. But with those regulations in place, consumers have recourse if they're harmed and companies are liable for medical bills, environmental cleanup, etc. Just kind of seems like common sense when the alternative to government regulation is letting companies bring their bottom line into the equation.

11. I believe our current administration is fascist. Not because I dislike them or because I can’t get over an election, but because I've spent too many years reading and learning about the Third Reich to miss the similarities. Not because any administration I dislike must be Nazis, but because things are actually mirroring authoritarian and fascist regimes of the past.

12. I believe the systemic racism and misogyny in our society is much worse than many people think, and desperately needs to be addressed. Which means those with privilege -- white, straight, male, economic, etc. -- need to start listening, even if you don't like what you're hearing, so we can start dismantling everything that's causing people to be marginalized.

13. I am not interested in coming after your blessed guns, nor is anyone serving in government. What I am interested in is the enforcement of present laws and enacting new, common sense gun regulations. Got another opinion? Put it on your page, not mine.

14. I believe in so-called political correctness. I prefer to think it’s social politeness. If I call you Chuck and you say you prefer to be called Charles I’ll call you Charles. It’s the polite thing to do. Not because everyone is a delicate snowflake, but because as Maya Angelou put it, when we know better, we do better. When someone tells you that a term or phrase is more accurate/less hurtful than the one you're using, you now know better. So why not do better? How does it hurt you to NOT hurt another person?

15. I believe in funding sustainable energy, including offering education to people currently working in coal or oil so they can change jobs. There are too many sustainable options available for us to continue with coal and oil. Sorry, billionaires. Maybe try investing in something else.

16. I believe that women should not be treated as a separate class of human. They should be paid the same as men who do the same work, should have the same rights as men and should be free from abuse. Why on earth shouldn’t they be?

I think that about covers it. Bottom line is that I'm a liberal because I think we should take care of each other. That doesn't mean you should work 80 hours a week so your lazy neighbor can get all your money. It just means I don't believe there is any scenario in which preventable suffering is an acceptable outcome as long as money is saved.""

When I get pissed off that a politician is trying to legislate Scripture into law, I'm not ""offended by Christianity"" -- I'm offended that you're trying to force me to live by your religion's rules. You know how you get really upset at the thought of Muslims imposing Sharia law on you? That's how I feel about Christians trying to impose biblical law on me. Be a Christian. Do your thing. Just don't force it on me or mine.

8. I don't believe LGBT people should have more rights than you. I just believe they should have the *same* rights as you.

9. I don't believe illegal immigrants should come to America and have the world at their feet, especially since THIS ISN'T WHAT THEY DO (spoiler: undocumented immigrants are ineligible for all those programs they're supposed to be abusing, and if they're ""stealing"" your job it's because your employer is hiring illegally). I believe there are far more humane ways to handle undocumented immigration than our current practices (i.e., detaining children, splitting up families, ending DACA, etc).

10. I don't believe the government should regulate everything, but since greed is such a driving force in our country, we NEED regulations to prevent cut corners, environmental destruction, tainted food/water, unsafe materials in consumable goods or medical equipment, etc. It's not that I want the government's hands in everything -- I just don't trust people trying to make money to ensure that their products/practices/etc. are actually SAFE. Is the government devoid of shadiness? Of course not. But with those regulations in place, consumers have recourse if they're harmed and companies are liable for medical bills, environmental cleanup, etc. Just kind of seems like common sense when the alternative to government regulation is letting companies bring their bottom line into the equation.

11. I believe our current administration is fascist. Not because I dislike them or because I can’t get over an election, but because I've spent too many years reading and learning about the Third Reich to miss the similarities. Not because any administration I dislike must be Nazis, but because things are actually mirroring authoritarian and fascist regimes of the past.

12. I believe the systemic racism and misogyny in our society is much worse than many people think, and desperately needs to be addressed. Which means those with privilege -- white, straight, male, economic, etc. -- need to start listening, even if you don't like what you're hearing, so we can start dismantling everything that's causing people to be marginalized.

13. I am not interested in coming after your blessed guns, nor is anyone serving in government. What I am interested in is the enforcement of present laws and enacting new, common sense gun regulations. Got another opinion? Put it on your page, not mine.

14. I believe in so-called political correctness. I prefer to think it’s social politeness. If I call you Chuck and you say you prefer to be called Charles I’ll call you Charles. It’s the polite thing to do. Not because everyone is a delicate snowflake, but because as Maya Angelou put it, when we know better, we do better. When someone tells you that a term or phrase is more accurate/less hurtful than the one you're using, you now know better. So why not do better? How does it hurt you to NOT hurt another person?

15. I believe in funding sustainable energy, including offering education to people currently working in coal or oil so they can change jobs. There are too many sustainable options available for us to continue with coal and oil. Sorry, billionaires. Maybe try investing in something else.

16. I believe that women should not be treated as a separate class of human. They should be paid the same as men who do the same work, should have the same rights as men and should be free from abuse. Why on earth shouldn’t they be?

I think that about covers it. Bottom line is that I'm a liberal because I think we should take care of each other. That doesn't mean you should work 80 hours a week so your lazy neighbor can get all your money. It just means I don't believe there is any scenario in which preventable suffering is an acceptable outcome as long as money is saved.""

""I'm a liberal, but that doesn't mean what a lot of you apparently think it does. Let's break it down, shall we? Because quite frankly, I'm getting a little tired of being told what I believe and what I stand for. Spoiler alert: not every liberal is the same, though the majority of liberals I know think along roughly these same lines:

1. I believe a country should take care of its weakest members. A country cannot call itself civilized when its children, disabled, sick, and elderly are neglected. PERIOD.

2. I believe healthcare is a right, not a privilege. Somehow that's interpreted as ""I believe Obamacare is the end-all, be-all."" This is not the case. I'm fully aware that the ACA has problems, that a national healthcare system would require everyone to chip in, and that it's impossible to create one that is devoid of flaws, but I have yet to hear an argument against it that makes ""let people die because they can't afford healthcare"" a better alternative. I believe healthcare should be far cheaper than it is, and that everyone should have access to it. And no, I'm not opposed to paying higher taxes in the name of making that happen.

3. I believe education should be affordable. It doesn't necessarily have to be free (though it works in other countries so I'm mystified as to why it can't work in the US), but at the end of the day, there is no excuse for students graduating college saddled with five- or six-figure debt.

4. I don't believe your money should be taken from you and given to people who don't want to work. I have literally never encountered anyone who believes this. Ever. I just have a massive moral problem with a society where a handful of people can possess the majority of the wealth while there are people literally starving to death, freezing to death, or dying because they can't afford to go to the doctor. Fair wages, lower housing costs, universal healthcare, affordable education, and the wealthy actually paying their share would go a long way toward alleviating this. Somehow believing that makes me a communist.

5. I don't throw around ""I'm willing to pay higher taxes"" lightly. If I'm suggesting something that involves paying more, well, it's because I'm fine with paying my share as long as it's actually going to something besides lining corporate pockets or bombing other countries while Americans die without healthcare.

6. I believe companies should be required to pay their employees a decent, livable wage. Somehow this is always interpreted as me wanting burger flippers to be able to afford a penthouse apartment and a Mercedes. What it actually means is that no one should have to work three full-time jobs just to keep their head above water. Restaurant servers should not have to rely on tips, multibillion-dollar companies should not have employees on food stamps, workers shouldn't have to work themselves into the ground just to barely make ends meet, and minimum wage should be enough for someone to work 40 hours and live.

7. I am not anti-Christian. I have no desire to stop Christians from being Christians, to close churches, to ban the Bible, to forbid prayer in school, etc. (BTW, prayer in school is NOT illegal; *compulsory* prayer in school is - and should be - illegal).

Even some very liberal people are tired of hearing the Nazi comparisons. I strongly agree, and when these men stop acting like Nazis, we can stop making the comparisons.  
  
Fascism is a virus that exploits a decent person’s good nature and desire for patience and understanding. It twists your desire for normalcy into a weapon and turns it back on you. If you do not speak out or act against it, you are complicit in it. It cannot be voted away (if that’s not already obvious). Patience and “understanding” are its fuel. The Nazi does not speak in your language; its only form of communication is fear and violence. You cannot “wait it out,” as no amount of blood can satiate it. It isn’t tied to a single person or party—though it often prefers the right—it will inhabit whatever host isn’t actively fighting it. It is, in effect, a living, breathing villain with unlimited time and resources at its disposal—like Satan.  
  
Four hundred thousand American grandfathers, great-grandfathers, and others gave their lives fighting fascism, with many millions more gravely injured or scarred by trauma. Many of us have seen the legacy of this damage firsthand. The absurdity of a man now making the hand gesture meant to praise Hitler and swear loyalty to him spits on that sacrifice.

I'm tired of people acting like it was the rhetoric of the Democrats that caused Trump to win. No, it was the *perceived* rhetoric from morons that caused Trump to win. People keep telling me how Democrats ran on identity politics. NO THEY FUCKING DIDN'T. Trump ran on identity politics and made his moronic constituents believe the Democrats were doing just that.

But I suppose Americans want white supremacists and Nazis in control. Because that's what they voted for in this election. Morons in swing states were mad the price of eggs were higher than four years ago so they voted with their wallets instead of their brains. 

Yet somehow... Democrats keep getting blamed for their rhetoric. For acting like they were above everyone else or calling everyone garbage. They never did or said any of that. Trump did though, for sure. 

It's just insane to me the direction this country is heading. And they're doing it because they're mad that inflation is a thing and refuse to understand it's not something the president even controls.

• It's a manifesto with full instructions on how to spread chaos and destroy our democracy and our institutions.

• The final intention is to ensure the installation of 34x Convicted Felon and Twice Impeached Insurrectionist President Trump as the king / dictator.

• His name is mentioned 312 times, even though he claims to have never heard of it. 

• Numerous members of his administration were contributors / writers of Project 2025.

Judge McConnell said what they are doing is against the law.

>*McConnell said his order was a response to evidence from the plaintiff states indicating that the pause on the freeze — which he said was causing ""irreparable harm"" and was ""likely unconstitutional"" — was being flouted. ""The States have presented evidence in this motion that the Defendants in some cases have continued to improperly freeze federal funds and refused to resume disbursement of appropriated federal funds,"" the judge wrote.*

The evidence clearly shows programs being stripped of funding even though an order was in place to stop it.

>*That evidence included descriptions of funding to the plaintiff states still being disrupted, including money from the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy, the National Institutes of Health, and the Department of Health and Human Services, including funds for the Head Start program.*

Our US Constitution is only as strong as the people willing to defend it.

Liberal,top,The Republicans are about to destroy the entire US healthcare system,"Rural hospitals get on average about 20% of their revenue from Medicaid, with some even higher. About 20% of discharges be it to skilled nursing faculty, long term facilities, or even home health are covered by Medicaid.  If you add in Medicare, the number jumps to greater than 50%.

Most of them are operating on a razors edge of staying open, with many closures even under current conditions.

A reduction of 5% of revenue is not feasible in a lot of communities.  A reduction of 20% would be catastrophic. The vast majority of rural hospitals would close.

Here is why it matters even to larger communities and hospitals.  Even the largest academic centers still get a portion of their funding from Medicaid. Losing that funding would likely not result in closure, but would result in cutbacks in staff and services.

With no local hospitals, people in all of those communities would have to go to the large hospitals for services. ER, inpatient and outpatient services would be overwhelmed quickly. 30+ ER wait times will become the norm. Boarding inpatients in the ER for days at a time will become the norm. The patients will be sicker, as a lot people who could have been easily treated will wait much longer for care and will be much sicker, requiring more and longer treatment.

Rural ambulance services will close. They depend on Medicaid for a large portion of their revenue as well. That and a 2 hour transfer to the closest hospital both ways for even the simplest hospital transfer wouldn’t be feasible either.

Nursing home and rehabs will close. They depend on Medicaid for a portion of their revenue. They also depend on local hospitals for simple things such an an X-ray after someone falls.

A reduction of 5% of revenue is not feasible in a lot of communities.  A reduction of 20% would be catastrophic. The vast majority of rural hospitals would close.

Here is why it matters even to larger communities and hospitals.  Even the largest academic centers still get a portion of their funding from Medicaid. Losing that funding would likely not result in closure, but would result in cutbacks in staff and services.

With no local hospitals, people in all of those communities would have to go to the large hospitals for services. ER, inpatient and outpatient services would be overwhelmed quickly. 30+ ER wait times will become the norm. Boarding inpatients in the ER for days at a time will become the norm. The patients will be sicker, as a lot people who could have been easily treated will wait much longer for care and will be much sicker, requiring more and longer treatment.

Rural ambulance services will close. They depend on Medicaid for a large portion of their revenue as well. That and a 2 hour transfer to the closest hospital both ways for even the simplest hospital transfer wouldn’t be feasible either.

Nursing home and rehabs will close. They depend on Medicaid for a portion of their revenue. They also depend on local hospitals for simple things such an an X-ray after someone falls. It’s difficult to run a facility when if a resident falls, there is no ambulance service to transport a patient and no hospital in a 100 mile radius to transport them to. Without the skilled facilities to accommodate hospital discharges, inpatient stays will be prolonged in an already overstressed system.

In a lot of communities the healthcare system is one of if not the largest employer. All those jobs will vanish.

If this big beautiful bill passes and becomes law, the healthcare system will collapse. I know that the Medicaid cuts are phased, not immediate, but even small cuts could have devastating consequences that will have ripple effects across the entire system.

It will hit deep red rural areas the quickest and hardest, but the system isn’t build to absorb that damage. ",658,638,20,I have put all my empathy away.

Liberal,top,I Escaped Right-Wing Media. Everyone Else Should Too.,"I used to watch Fox News and was an avid listener to Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Mark Levin, and other right-wing radio personalities. I believed everything they told me, and they played a key role in establishing my worldview.

That all changed on January 6, 2021. It became clear in the aftermath of that tragedy that Trump had made up a pack of lies about the election being stolen, and had engaged in criminal conduct to hold onto power. I assumed at that point that right-wing media would stop supporting him.

Boy, was I wrong! They only doubled down in their support for him, even allowing him to use them as a bully-pulpit against his political rivals in the 2024 primary. I decided at that point I was done with right-wing media, and when the Republican party re-nominated Trump, I decided I was done with it too.

Since escaping the right-wing media bubble, I've come to realize what an alternate reality universe it is. In this fantasy land tax cuts pay for themselves, conservative judges aren't activist and rule strictly according to the Constitution, Democrats are communists who hate America, and Trump is the true American patriot come to save it.

Of course all of that is B.S., but it gets ratings, and it explains why millions of people will support Trump, no matter what he does. They need to be brought to understand that right-wing media is not news in any objective sense of the word, but rather propaganda designed to push a political agenda. Its pundits have no journalistic standards whatsoever, and they and their guests routinely omit and misrepresent facts to create their false narratives.

So cultish has their devotion to Trump become that they excuse his crimes and blatant Constitutional violations, thus making them complicit in his authoritarian takeover of the country.

Another egregious crime of right-wing media is the use of selective facts, and even outright lies, to stir up hared against migrants and trans people. As a result, their listeners are just fine with masked agents kidnapping people and sending them to concentration camps and stripping transgender people of any rights whatsoever.

They need to be brought to understand that right-wing media is not news in any objective sense of the word, but rather propaganda designed to push a political agenda. Its pundits have no journalistic standards whatsoever, and they and their guests routinely omit and misrepresent facts to create their false narratives.

So cultish has their devotion to Trump become that they excuse his crimes and blatant Constitutional violations, thus making them complicit in his authoritarian takeover of the country.

Another egregious crime of right-wing media is the use of selective facts, and even outright lies, to stir up hared against migrants and trans people. As a result, their listeners are just fine with masked agents kidnapping people and sending them to concentration camps and stripping transgender people of any rights whatsoever.

Because it aids and abets criminality and fascism and spreads disinformation, right-wing media poses a clear and present danger to the Republic. I'm so glad I finally escaped from it, and everyone else should too.",645,606,39,"This is what I find so frustrating about the post election navel gazing about what the democrats did wrong, what the democrats have to do, what policies the democrats can propose that will reach the trump supporter, and so on. All of that is ridiculous because whatever the democrats do, half the country will never hear about it, or will only know it through some twisted negative interpretation. I think Harris ran a great campaign and did nothing wrong. The problem was her opponent was allowed to flat out lie without being called out on it, and has a propaganda machine that is the only ""news"" that half the country sees. 

Until we come up with an answer to that, nothing the democrats do will make a difference.",9,2025-09-20 06:22:21,2025-09-20 14:46:41,0.9

A few things I want to point out about this.

Republicans had the votes for a budget reconciliation, but this would not have allowed them to include a lot of non-budgetary riders that they were trying to attach to the budget.

This indicates that the riders are more important to them than actually passing a budget or that they intentionally included them as poison pills for the budget to ensure that it would not pass.

Republicans were no showing meetings that were meant to come to a compromise on the budget.

This indicates that they had no real intention of avoiding a shutdown.

Republicans didn't even show up to Congress tonight to try to work out a solution or pass a continuing resolution.  As a group, they chose to not show up to work and address this pressing issue.

This indicates that they had no real intention of avoiding a shutdown.

The Republican Senate Majority leader has even been threatening that Republicans will not negotiate at all in the event of a shutdown, which shows they have no real intention of honestly resolving the shutdown.

Just a couple years ago at this time, Republicans almost forced another shutdown to occur because they refused to honor an agreement on the budget that they had made just a few months prior.  When their current speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, agreed to work with Democrats to pass a continuing resolution, Republicans became outraged and removed him as speaker of the house.

They removed their own speaker of the house because he did not follow through and force the government into a shutdown in bad faith. The current Republican speaker of the House was the eventual chosen replacement for McCarthy.  They felt he was more in line with what they wanted.

This indicates that current Republicans in Congress have a history of attempting to force the government into shutdown for bad faith reasons.

Republicans wanted this shutdown and did literally nothing to avoid it.  They forced it by putting a poison pill into the budget bill that would have revoked health care from millions of Americans and would have driven the insurance premiums up for millions more.  They did this with the intention that it would force Democrats to oppose the bill.

Republicans wanted this shutdown. They did everything possible to work for it.",47,2025-10-02 14:04:22,2025-10-02 14:56:48,0.9

",592,568,24,"Cutting the federal support for health insurance bought on the market was part of the Big Beautiful Bill, Dems wanted federal supports continued, because the system will pretty well collapse when the premium costs for individuals are so high, all but the sickest individuals give up coverage.  The entire system is predicated on a large group with many younger, healthy individuals contributing to offset the higher expenses of the sickest people. Withdrawing federal premium contributions essentially causes the entire system to implode.  Hospitals would close when providing mandated emergency care to the uninsured  became unsustainable.  Uninsured tend to use emergency rooms, the most expensive way to provide health care.
The incredible misery this would cause for so many sick people is unimaginable.  Driving healthcare to the edge of complete collapse reveals the absence of any moral compass by the “architect of project 2025”Russ Vought, and the Heritage Foundation.

The money we have spent on Ukraine in a proxy war against Russia has been well spent but it is all wasted if we don’t see this through to fruition. 

It may not be immediately but eventually the consequences will be that we will be sending our own into battle which was preventable.

Carville, Clintons, Pelosis, and Shumers all need to go away.

I've been a Democrat since my first vote--John Kerry. They're going to have to earn it next time. We've already got Trump 2.0. Telling me, ""We're running against a once in a lifetime madman"" doesn't work now that he's won twice. 

Obama--imagine this: Trumpers don't give a shit if what he's doing is hypocritical. It seems like the voters leaving the democratic party don't care either. This is the same line of attack Dems have tried to use since he arrived on that stupid ass escalator in a JC Pennys or whatever. I really have little hope if this is what we're cheerleading.

For those who think Trump is just being stupid, you weren't paying attention when he said he liked the tariffs of the 1890s. 

That was the time when most of the federal government's revenue came from tariffs, because *there were no personal income taxes.*

And of course, if there are tariffs on other countries, there will be a trade war. Which will decrease US exports, and likely cause a recession. 

Meanwhile, I wouldn't count on Trump eliminating all personal income taxes for everyone. Republicans could just get rid of the top earned income tax bracket. 

And then, reduce capital gains tax rates. As capital gains on asset sales and qualified dividends constitute the bulk of the very wealthy's income. Most of them don't make much at all in earned income.

So then tarrifs + continued earned income tax rates for the 99% means the 99% will be paying a much higher share of the federal government's budget.",51,2024-11-28 20:40:10,2024-11-28 21:19:13,0.9

But I'm crazy of course to say this so fuck me right?",559,475,84,"People don't realize things can change drastically. When I was growing up in NYC in the 1960s and early 1970s, there were no homeless people or beggars on the streets. None. There were places on the Bowery where a bunch of poor people could sleep on the floor of a room, and SROs, which offered cheap small rooms with shared bathrooms and no kitchen. I first saw a woman begging in 1975 and my friends thought she was a prostitute. That same year I first saw a small pile of men sleeping on a grate to keep warm. For the last 50 years tenant advocates have been warning that government policies that favored landlords and developers were destroying the cheap housing stock. 

Less dramatic, but equally intense has been the change in ""security"". Before 2001, you could go to an airport and walk your friends almost to the plane. You could hang out in an airport and watch planes take off, just for fun. You didn't have to be there 3 hours early to go through security. You could bring anything legal on the plane with you--things like knitting needles and penknives and scissors. On domestic flights, no one looked at your luggage. No one would dream of making you go through a metal detector and take your shoes off. You could go into almost any government or commercial building without metal detectors. You might have to show some ID, but that was it. I remember being told how terrible it was in Russia that people needed identification papers to travel between cities. I didn't carry ID till I was in my late 20s. I traveled to the Caribbean and to Canada with only a voter registration card to prove my citizenship. 

We don't know exactly how things will change now, but no one should underestimate the potential for a much crueler, less free United States in the near future.",52,2024-11-28 20:40:10,2024-11-28 21:13:45,0.95

 ",0,0,0,"Unfortunately, she didn’t have nearly the amount of time Trump had. I mean, the guy has been in perpetual rally mode since he got elected the first time around. He was campaigning as soon as Biden was declared the victor. Then Biden drops out in August, Kamala steps in and she had 100 days to play catch-up. Hindsight is 2020, but the odds weren’t good for her.

I definitely think she would’ve benefited if her campaign team got her time with the likes of Joe Rogan, even though that would’ve been a hornets nest, or even some of the liberal voices on TikTok or twitch - hell, any of the streaming platforms that are available.

A few years ago, I actually thought that the Dems had a good opportunity to capitalize on the way the media is transforming. Traditional media outlets have been struggling. Millennials and Gen Z very rarely utilize them and even GenX is getting the idea, slowly. 

I don’t know on the exact number, but I can honestly say that I know of maybe two liberal/progressive talkshow hosts that are on traditional over the air radio and there has to be at least 4 to 5 times that number for conservative talkers. 

TV is probably about the same though. MSNBC is definitely leaning left. Meanwhile, you have Fox News, FOXBusiness channel, Newsmax and OAN. Yeah, conservatives will swear up and down. CNN is being liberal, but I hear just as many liberals complain about CNN trying to pander to conservatives so I think that’s debatable.

All that being said, conservative media vastly outnumbers liberal media.

 ",0,0,0,"Harris ran a great campaign. 

If Republicans had not run a tyrant who created a tsunami of misinformation, so that he could con people into voting for him, Harris would have won. 

So I'm not convinced that *any* different campaign strategies would have helped. The Republicans stacked the deck against her.

It's also helpful to know that young males are, historically, the most easily radicalized group. So Trump could go on Rogan and some of the bro networks, and turn them to him because they are highly susceptible to the strong man appeal. 

Harris doesn't have the same kind of powerful rhetorical appeal to use with those audiences. She wasn't likely to be able to counter what Trump was able to do with young males.",1,2024-11-14 06:09:07,2024-11-14 16:17:36,0.8

If these people did commit the crimes they're saying they did, that is good and they should be off the streets, and subject to a fair trial to be held accountable (if their trials are not completed). 

 Interesting that they showed ""collateral arrests"" which is arresting someone they weren't targeting, and saying it like they're proud to get collateral arrests, which makes me think they are checking papers of people in or around these raid locations looking for people to collaterally arrest (potentially with little to no probable cause), which imo is unconstitutional",22,2025-01-23 21:13:33,2025-01-23 21:31:54,0.5

* Dems need to focus on concrete solutions, and abandon all of the feelings and vibes nonsense.  I could hear it in almost every speech the last 4 years.  Dripping with feelings and warm fuzzies. Just stop.  Propose long-term solutions, or don't even try.  The vast majority of Americans want problem solving, not an emotional bath.  ""A, B, and C are problems, and we think X, Y, and Z will address at least some of it, and here's how, and here's how it gets paid for.""
* DEAL WITH THE BORDER.  I used to think the greatest unforced political error in history was Romney's ""my message is for you, not the 47% of Americans that don't pay taxes.""  Not anymore.  Escorting millions of border crossers into red border states - who then bussed them to blue cities and suburbs -  is now the greatest unforced political error that the free world will ever see.
* Stop marching dudes with mustaches, red lipstick, and dresses in front of voters. I believe most folks don't care what the individual does with their own time, but for the love of god, don't alienate voters like you did.  That was another unforced political error.
* Never again make the mistake of pigeon-holing the other candidate as a nazi or a felon, without proving to voters beyond a shadow of a doubt that your vision of governance (taxation, foreign policy, economic growth measures, etc) is better than theirs.
* Never again run for president and tell voters that you want to raise taxes.  Even if it's only on high earners.  High earners have kids, parents, siblings, friends, and neighbors who all vote also.  If a reporter ever asks a future dem candidate about their position on taxes, the answer should be ""we feel strongly that we need to get the nose of the national debt pointed back into a safer trajectory. We have a list of investments in infrastructure that need to be addressed, but nothing - no bridges, no roads, no dams, no power lines - is going to be replaced if republicans keep eroding the tax base and driving us ever deeper in debt. We're on a bad trajectory, and both sides got us there.""

* Dems need to focus on concrete solutions, and abandon all of the feelings and vibes nonsense.  I could hear it in almost every speech the last 4 years.  Dripping with feelings and warm fuzzies. Just stop.  Propose long-term solutions, or don't even try.  The vast majority of Americans want problem solving, not an emotional bath.  ""A, B, and C are problems, and we think X, Y, and Z will address at least some of it, and here's how, and here's how it gets paid for.""
* DEAL WITH THE BORDER.  I used to think the greatest unforced political error in history was Romney's ""my message is for you, not the 47% of Americans that don't pay taxes.""  Not anymore.  Escorting millions of border crossers into red border states - who then bussed them to blue cities and suburbs -  is now the greatest unforced political error that the free world will ever see.
* Stop marching dudes with mustaches, red lipstick, and dresses in front of voters. I believe most folks don't care what the individual does with their own time, but for the love of god, don't alienate voters like you did.  That was another unforced political error.
* Never again make the mistake of pigeon-holing the other candidate as a nazi or a felon, without proving to voters beyond a shadow of a doubt that your vision of governance (taxation, foreign policy, economic growth measures, etc) is better than theirs.
* Never again run for president and tell voters that you want to raise taxes.  Even if it's only on high earners.  High earners have kids, parents, siblings, friends, and neighbors who all vote also.  If a reporter ever asks a future dem candidate about their position on taxes, the answer should be ""we feel strongly that we need to get the nose of the national debt pointed back into a safer trajectory. We have a list of investments in infrastructure that need to be addressed, but nothing - no bridges, no roads, no dams, no power lines - is going to be replaced if republicans keep eroding the tax base and driving us ever deeper in debt. We're on a bad trajectory, and both sides got us there.""
* Don't ever - ever, ever, ever, ever - ignore inflation again.   ",43,27,16,"People make decisions based on emotion,and then retcon reasons to justify the decision. There is a reason why Marketing: is a thing.

Look at the economy. It is stronger now than it has been in hte last 60 years, but nobody is telling voters that. Are some people struggling? Certainly, but there have always been people struggling.

Inflation was at 4% when Reagan left office--double what it is now--and he is remembered as a great economic president.  Reagan averaged 7% unemployment, roughly double what it is now. Under Biden, wage growth outpaced inflation, under Reagan, wages actually *fell.* From 1980 to 1983, those living in poverty increased from 13% to 15.2%. From 1984 to 1987, the homeless population doubled. The federal debt went fromm $738 billion to $2.1 trillion during Reagan's time in office. In 1984, the interest rate on a 30-year mortgage was 13.87%, double what it is now.

Reagan claimed it was morning in America in 1984, that the economy was booming, and won in a landslide. How was he able to do this? *The media helped him.* The media told people things were great, and people believed it. It *felt* like things were great, so things *were* great.

Today, even though the economy is roaring and everyone has a job, the media searched out some rube is Gobbler's Knob who laments egg prices (which the government has very little if anything to do with) and OH MY GOD THE ECONOMY IS A HELLSCAPE. Nobody bothered to explain how global supply chains, and avian flu impact the nations poultry production. 

People focus on eggs going up, but ignore the fact that you can get a 75"" TV for less than $400. 

This is why MAGA demonizes migrants and men with moustaches and lipstick. It's to get people to ignore how good things actually are, and focus on the horror that is individual expression--another thing people claim to like but are terrified of and actually hate.

No amount of explaining reality, or changing the message, or anything else will combat this. No matter how Democrats message, it is the Hate Machine that names things, describes things, and controls things. 

Already, polls show that people think the economy is improving even though things are the same as they were a week ago. It's because Trump won, and he is good on economic issues (LOL), so everything is better. This is simply because the media isn't focused on telling people how bad things are anymore.

I am curious as to how they are going to spin the economic disaster that's coming. It's going to take some really heavy spinning to blame Democrats.",20,2024-11-11 17:25:43,2024-11-11 18:43:56,0.5

How can people not understand that trying to cling to the phrasings of a dozen men who don't have the same knowledge as your average high schooler today, who had no issue considering black people and women less than fully entitled human beings, may have fucked it up a little?

The Michele Carter case resulted in conviction because of its specificity and clear direction/manipulation. The important part here then his speech is different than words.

Pete Hegseth, a Fox News Host with nazi symbols on his body, and clearly announced feelings regarding the U.S. Constitution (that is contrary to current U.S. Constitution written text) has been nominated to be the Secretary of Defense.

>*In 2021, Hegseth was one of 12 National Guard members removed from a role guarding President Biden's inauguration after vetting by military officials due to possible extremist ties. He has tattoos associated with white supremacists and neo-Nazis (on a recent podcast, Hegseth defended one as ""just a Christian symbol"").*

No matter how it is explained by sycophants loyal to the negativity of the Republicans and their cult leader?

Numerous searches will provide  references on the internet and social media platforms that refer to the symbols as being attached to negative connotations, including pro-Natzi and anti-Muslim extremist movements. 

>*...it is important to know that symbols and language tied to the Crusades are very present in some extremist movements. You know, this was a symbol on display on January 6. It was contained in the writings of neo-Nazi mass-shooter who killed scores at a summer camp in Norway in 2011. And it could signal a deep antipathy toward Islam.*

He has explained his agenda and what he plans to do.

>*Hegseth is the author of the recent book ""The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free,"" a New York Times bestseller, in which he denounces what he calls the ""warped, woke, and caustic policies of our current military."" In it, he blamed former President Barack Obama and the Pentagon for shortfalls in recruitment, claiming they ""embraced the social justice messages of gender equity, racial diversity, climate stupidity, and the LGBTQA+ alphabet soup in their recruiting pushes."" He continued: ""Only one problem: There just aren't enough lesbians from San Francisco who want to join the 82nd Airborne. Not only do the lesbians not join, but those very same ads turn off the young, patriotic, Christian men who have traditionally filled our ranks.""*

Please🙏 for our military.

Please surround them with the knowledge and capabilities to withstand the pressure of a white supremist who happens to be a Trump loyalist.

Trump and his sycophants have taken the first steps to destroy America.

Trump ordered Congress to take an unplanned recess so that his suggested cabinet appointments can sail through with NO vetting or Congressional inquiry / approval.

>*Trump's plan to use recess appointments, along with the announcement that Republican senators' support bypassing the Senate vetting process, is unusual.This exception to the process means that when the Senate is on recess, the president can make an appointment to a position that normally requires Senate approval. The process was created when Congress didn't meet as often as it does today, and was to be used in emergencies. It is also supposed to be a temporary appointment and expires at the end of a congressional session - at most, one year.*

This method of getting appointments through was used previously, but SCOTUS decided against it in 2014 when President Obama used it to make some appointments. I wonder if it means Trump needs SCOTUS approval to use it again? 

>*Some past presidents have employed the method liberally, often as a way of circumventing political divides that would slow nominations. George W Bush made 171 recess appointments, Bill Clinton made 139 and Barack Obama made at least 32, according to the Congressional Research Service (CRS). This method of getting nominees into office was virtually stopped after the Supreme Court ruled against Obama in 2014, striking down multiple recess appointments and calling them unconstitutional.*

The process to vet presidential  nominees is to complete numerous forms and provide testimony via a Senate committee (where commitee members may pose questions). Afterwards, a full vote of the Senate will take place to approve the nomination. 
  
>*The Senate approval process requires nominees to submit financial disclosure forms, fill out a questionnaire - which differs based on the role - and testify before a Senate committee. These hearings can sometimes be contentious. They allow members from both political parties to question nominees about their backgrounds and plans for the post. After the hearing, the committee votes on the nomination. If it approves the candidate, the full Senate then votes on the nominee.*

A simple Senate majority is needed to ensure the nominee is approved.

>*A simple majority of senators present at the time of the vote is necessary to approve the nominee, according to the center.*

Ah, at long last... The kitten who behaves!

To be honest, being ***unashamedly yourself*** and bluntly ***honest*** (but ***not mean*** about it) is the key to being a good liberal. Don't let anyone tell you what to say (but ""how"" to say it is a noble enough thing to ask sometimes). 
    
To start, make sure you understand the nomenclature clearly:
    
**Liberal/Progressive** < =•= > **Conservative/Regressive** *is a social/ideological scale that people place their own and others opinions on.*
    
**Democratic, Republican, Green and Libertarian** *are political parties in the US.* 
   
**Independent** *is a label for politicians who refuse to choose a party.* 
    
**libertarian** (notice the lowercase l) *is also on the social/ideological scale or it creates a triangulation scale.*
    
**The Libertarian Party** *is actually almost the opposite of what American libertarians really believe. Most people recognize the L-party as just more Republicans trying on a different costume.*
    
**The Green Party** *is often seen by Democrats merely as spoilers who can never win an election but who can make a Democrat lose one.*",7,2024-11-15 07:34:31,2024-11-15 08:47:14,0.9
