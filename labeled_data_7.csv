Politics,controversial,First trans politician Sarah McBride elected to Congress,,0,0,0,"Congress will see its first openly transgender member with the election of Sarah McBride to Delaware’s single seat in the House of Representatives.

Ms McBride, a former state senator, easily defeated her Republican opponent, former state trooper John Whalen, in the blue state.

The 34 year-old is a close friend of the Biden family, and is credited with helping shape the [US president’s stance on LGBTQ issues](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/04/20/biden-undoing-decades-of-womens-rights-with-title-ix-change/).

She previously worked for Mr Biden’s late son, Beau Biden, when he was running to be attorney general in his home state.

The president also wrote the foreword to Ms McBride’s 2018 memoir, Tomorrow Will Be Different.

Although Ms McBride did not lean on the historic nature of her run, she campaigned on a theme of respect for all.

“Tonight is a testament to Delawareans that we have shown time and time again that in this state of neighbours, we judge candidates based on their ideas and not their identities,” Ms McBride said in her victory speech.

“I didn’t run to make history. I ran to make a difference for my state and this country,” she added.

“I think this is a powerful message that Delawareans are fair-minded and that our democracy is big enough for all of us.”

Ms McBride has an established national profile as an LGBTQ activist, and became the first openly transgender person to address a major party convention when she delivered a speech at the DNC in 2016.

She raised more than $3 million in campaign contributions from around the country for her bid to enter Congress.

Delaware’s sole seat in the House was vacated by Lisa Blunt Rochester, who ran to replace retiring Democratic senator Tom Carper in the state.

She lost because of bad information.

Politics,controversial,The Right Wants to Exterminate Trans People. Liberals Are Helping.,,5,2,3,">It’s not that centrists have been engaging in the same Nazi-style rhetoric as conservatives. But the anti-trans hysteria that has swept through the United States over the past few years would never have found so much purchase without the participation of elite liberal political and media institutions. The New York Times and The Atlantic have published story after story about the supposed dangers of gender-affirming care, particularly for minors, and stoked fears about trans people’s participation in sports. These scaremongering campaigns may come dressed in more respectable clothing than a Fox News rant, but they are similarly grounded in myth.

…

>Transphobes exploited this coverage—after all, if “even the liberal New York Times” was concerned, there must be something going on, right? Times coverage has been used by a wide range of politicians, lawyers, and courts to justify anti-trans policies; Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas cited the paper seven times in his opinion in US vs. Skrmetti, one of the most significant attacks on trans rights in recent memory.

…

>These days, it seems that not a week goes by without some prominent Democrat bashing trans people—despite the Trump administration’s placing a bigger and bigger target on their backs. California Governor Gavin Newsom, seen as a leading potential contender in the 2028 presidential election, infamously declared in a podcast with Kirk that it was “deeply unfair” for trans women and girls to compete with cis women and girls in sports. Former Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, whose name is also in the 2028 mix, rejected the idea of trans identity completely in a conversation with Megyn Kelly, saying, “Can a man become a woman?

Harris sidestepped any real discussion on the economy and simply ran as ""not Trump"". I watched her and she sidestepped every opportunity to give real answers. With the economy feeling bad to people she needed to say more than ""not Trump"". Mistake 3.

Politics,controversial,Bernie Agrees: Democratic Party Is a ‘Threat to Democracy’,,2,1,1,"**Bernie Agrees: Democratic Party Is a ‘Threat to Democracy’
Bernie Sanders has some harsh words for the party he once hoped to lead.**

*In a May 19 appearance on the Flagrant podcast, Sanders joined hosts Andrew Schulz and Akaash Singh in a rant about the Democratic Party’s handling of the 2024 presidential election, at one point agreeing with Singh that the party has become “a threat to democracy.”*

*The episode opened with Schulz introducing Sanders as having been “mocked, sidelined, and betrayed—and that’s just by his own party,” earning a laugh from the senator.*

*For the next 90 minutes, Sanders, 83, joined the hosts in a frank breakdown of his issues with the Democratic Party.*

*Schulz, who described himself as a “lifelong Democrat,” complained that establishment Democrats seemed incapable of connecting with young and working-class voters. Sanders echoed his woes, venting that even after losing the 2024 election, his colleagues still “won’t listen” to him about how to appeal to voters.*

*While Sanders credited the Biden administration for being open to discussion and “understanding that [Sanders] represented millions of people,” he said that willingness has gone away since the former president left office.*

*“You’ve got a Democratic establishment which is funded by wealthy people,” said Sanders. “You have consultants who are really way out of touch with reality who make a whole lot of money in campaigns, and the working class is ignored.”*

*The senator blamed Kamala Harris’ loss on these same consultants, saying he “begged” her team not to move forward with messaging that implied her presidency would be a redux of Joe Biden’s. However, the senator agreed with Schulz and Singh that Democrats had generally mishandled the 2024 election.*

*“Democrats, we felt that we didn’t have a say on who could be president,” lamented Schulz. “We talk a lot about the Republicans being autocrats and oligarchs and taking over democracy. But from the Democrat perspective—and I’m a lifelong Democrat—I felt like the Democratic Party completely removed the democratic process from its constituents. And I think they need to have some accountability [for] that.”*

*“No argument here,” Sanders replied.*

*However, Sanders did strongly disagree with one of his host’s points when Schulz expressed disappointment that, despite being sidelined by the establishment, Sanders continued to back Democratic nominees like Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Kamala Harris in 2024.*

*“[Trump] won anyway, so why not just burn it all down?” asked Schulz.*

*“Because it’s easy to say,” said Sanders. “But ‘burning it down’ means children will not have food to eat. The schools will deteriorate. People will not have healthcare. I’m an elected official. I’ve got to represent the people. I can’t turn my back on them.”*

*Singh interjected with another question: “But could we not also say, if there hasn’t been a fair primary for the Democrats since 2008, are they not also a threat to democracy?”*

*“Fair enough,” Sanders answered. “I’m not gonna argue with that.”*",19,2025-05-20 03:19:33,2025-05-20 03:20:51,0.6

Politics,controversial,Colombia backs down in migrant row with Trump after president threatens tariffs,,17,9,8,"***The Telegraph reports:***

Colombia has backed down in a row over migrants with Donald Trump after the US president threatened to hit the South American country with punitive tariffs.

On Sunday Mr Trump said he would impose the measures on Colombia in an angry response to the South American country blocking [migrant deportation flights](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2025/01/24/hundreds-illegal-immigrants-already-arrested-deported-trump/).

Mr Trump warned the measures, including immediate 25 per cent taxes on Colombian goods among a broad range of sanctions, were “only just the beginning”.

He said tariffs would increase to 50 per cent after one week.

A few hours later, the White House announced it was shelving the tariffs plan after Colombia agreed to accept deported migrants, but other penalties would remain in place.

Colombia has agreed to “unrestricted acceptance of all illegal aliens from Colombia returned from the United States, including on US military aircraft, without limitation or delay,” a White House statement said.

“Today’s events make clear to the world that America is respected again,” it added.

“President Trump will continue to fiercely protect our nation’s sovereignty, and he expects all other nations of the world to fully cooperate in accepting the deportation of their citizens illegally present in the United States.”

Colombia’s foreign minister confirmed it had “overcome the impasse” with Washington and added that it would “continue receiving Colombians who return as deportees”.

Schumer is old, out of touch and unpopular with younger voters. Beyond being the title of my sex tape, that is bad news for his reelection chances and his seat is up in 2028.

Should he retire, AOC is in a great position to win the primary and then the general. If he doesn't retire, she would likely win a primary given she is a lot more popular than Schumer, though it could turn off some centrist dems.

If that were to happen, a strong, moderate republican could have a better chance than if Schumer retired. Had Stefanik not gone full MAGA, she would have been able to peel moderates from AOC after a primary win against Schumer.

AOC is young. A seat in the senate will strengthen her reach and give her better experience than with the hoi polloi in the house. Should a dem win in 28, she can support the administration in the senate, serve her full term and run in 36.

She would be in her mid 40s then with almost a decade in the Senate added to her already strong advocacy in the house. Even if she lost the primary then, she'd still have her senate seat as 36 will be two years into her second term.",8,2025-04-17 23:28:26,2025-04-17 23:47:52,0.6

Politics,controversial,Does the Democratic Party Have a Death Wish?,,0,0,0,"Every thing he said was true, but his solution is a non starter. Third parties don't work. I say that as a 2000s era Naderite. You have to defeat these people using the Democratic Primary system. Does that seem like mission impossible? Yes, but it is easier than trying to form a new party. All you need are enough voters in a district to show up to the primary. That's much easier than trying to get multiples of that number to vote for a 3rd party candidate in the general. The corporate Dems controlling the party are insufferable; the fact that they've lost to Trump twice says it all really. You have to take them out in primaries though.

There's actually a template for this: Republicans. Today's Republicans are not the same people that controlled the party 20 years ago.

Politics,controversial,Kamala Harris Accuses Biden’s Team of Sabotaging Her,,11,5,6,"I know she needs to sell a book and everything, so I see what she's doing here.  Bottom line, whoever got Joe to run again is to blame, there SHOULD have been a primary, and that was what doomed the election.



Look, let's be brutally honest about 2024, otherwise we're doomed to repeat it.  Kamala was a bad candidate.  Had there been a primary, she would have exposed how bad of a candidate she was and someone else would have been nominated, she NEVER would have been the candidate unless they did another anointment like they did with Hillary - which is essentially what happened.  Kamala was NEVER going to win the general because she was such a bad candidate.  Joe running again was a HORRIBLE idea from the start, so blame Jill Biden or whoever decided to made that happen.  However, once that die was cast, the Dem apparatus was stuck with only 2 possible options to recover from the shitshow Biden debate, and that was it.

The options were to rehabilitate Biden's image after that shitshow of a debate, which they actually attempted for a full MONTH, and was doomed to failure as it was an impossible task from the level of decline he was displaying - or anoint the VP as the candidate.  There wasn't time for any realistic primary once Joe dropped out with around 3 months until the election.  Doing anything other than those 2 options would have exposed how weak Biden/Harris had become, and would require undoing all of their messaging and everything 3ish months before the election.  



There just wasn't time to do anything other than what they tried under the circumstances.  However, I hope they have fully realized that trying to anoint candidates that have no charisma, and are very much disliked figures by a good percentage of voters is now shown and confirmed to be what NOT to do from the 2 times they did this and lost to the conman currently sitting in the Oval.",10,2025-09-10 17:27:32,2025-09-10 17:51:05,0.0

Quotes from the book mentioned in article 

> When Fox News attacked me on everything from my laugh, to my tone of voice, to whom I’d dated in my 20s, or claimed I was a “DEI hire,” the White House rarely pushed back with my actual résumé: two terms elected D.A., top cop in the second-largest department of justice in the United States, senator representing one in eight Americans….

> They had a huge comms team; they had Karine Jean-Pierre briefing in the pressroom every day. But getting anything positive said about my work or any defense against untrue attacks was almost impossible.

> Joe was already polling badly on the age issue, with roughly 75 percent of voters saying he was too old to be an effective president. Then he started taking on water for his perceived blank check to Benjamin Netanyahu in Gaza.

> When polls indicated that I was getting more popular, the people around him didn’t like the contrast that was emerging….

> Their thinking was zero-sum: If she’s shining, he’s dimmed. None of them grasped that if I did well, he did well. That given the concerns about his age, my visible success as his vice president was vital. It would serve as a testament to his judgment in choosing me and reassurance that if something happened, the country was in good hands. My success was important for him.

   1. By Time-Limits I mean, rules like ""A motion for dissolution of Parliament cannot be called within 100 days of the fixed-term election"".

Ask_Politics,hot,Were any of the Pro-Trump or otherwise far-right Dank Memes on Vine astroturfed by groups like Cambridge Analytica?,"When I was about 20 or 21, Dank Meme Vine compilations were a huge phenomenon on YouTube, and many of said compilations seemed to have strong populist right messaging, often featuring overtly Pro-Trump/Anti-Hillary memes, anti-feminist memes, anti-LGBT memes/jokes about how many genders there are, etc. Granted, these were interspersed with bog-standard absurdist or edgy memes, but the editorial slant of these compilations was pretty clear.

Having heard all the recent discourse about this Jubilee debate between Medhi Hasan and young conservatives (at least one of whom reportedly accepted the label of ""fascist""), it occurs to me that a lot of the youths in that video are probably young enough to have seen these compilations when their political consciousness was just starting to develop and to have had their outlooks shaped by these memes on some subconscious level. More broadly, Gen Z is noticeably flipping right (as demonstrated during this past election cycle), and internet culture is playing an increasingly bigger role in youth politics, so I wonder if Dank Meme Vines were one of the initial catalysts for this shift, and if so, whether lobbyist/special interest/data mining groups were involved.

As cursory as my understanding of cyber warfare is, I do know that Cambridge Analytica used Facebook surveys to build psychological profiles of users, disseminate targeted Pro-Trump memes to these users, and covertly influence their voting decisions/political opinions. With that in mind, could a group like Cambridge Analytica or even a foreign political body like the Kremlin have produced Pro-Trump/populist right Dank Memes as a form of astroturfing and subsequently paid compilation producers to curate Dank Meme compilations in a way that favored far-right interests? Given how people like Peter Thiel are now essentially psyopping Zoomers into ""trad"" ideology with faux-grassroots ""new media"" or how Tim Pool (a self-proclaimed ""independent journalist"") was revealed to have taken funding from RT, it wouldn't surprise me if some Machiavellian organization had also used Vine/Dank Memes as a covert influence on youth politics circa 2016.",13,13,0,"Welcome to /r/ask_politics.

It used to be very common for working class people to be in a union, and unions would regularly hold big social/community events, like spaghetti dinners, for members and their families. 

Democratic Party politicians used to rely on going to Union meetings to win primaries, before Dems stopped focusing on blue collar union workers and trying to woo moderate republicans.

I have mixed opinions about some of Conover’s stuff, but that one was rather thought provoking.

Ask_Politics,hot,Is shifting FEMA to state-sponsored programs good for Blue States?,"Reading a bit about the winding down of FEMA programs and Trump’s suggestion that the states should bear more of the burden. Without doing any research, is it true most disasters occur in red states? CA wildfires, earthquakes maybe, Colorado fires, but majority of hurricanes and such happen in the south? Is this bias because the current floods are in Texas. If this is true, Florida and red states will have to carry a greater burden than what is otherwise being contributed to by northern blue states who have, on the whole, less disasters. Tl;dr will blue states end up paying less and red states paying more if disaster relief is shifted to states?

Ask_Politics,hot,"If Iran isn’t building a nuclear bomb, why are they enriching uranium to 60% — way beyond what’s needed for energy?","I keep seeing people on Reddit say there’s ""no proof"" that Iran is building a nuclear weapon — and I get that. Intelligence agencies and the IAEA haven’t confirmed an active weapons program.

But what I don’t get is:  
Why would Iran enrich uranium to 60% purity, when nuclear power reactors only use 3–5% enriched uranium?  
That seems like a huge red flag — especially since going from 60% to weapons-grade (90%) is a much smaller step than going from 3%.

Iran claims the 60% enrichment is for medical isotope production, but from what I’ve read, medical applications (like producing technetium-99m) only require around 20% enrichment at most. So that explanation doesn’t seem to hold up. Why would they go three times higher than necessary if the goal was medical?

If they’re not building a bomb, then what are they doing it for?  
The whole thing seems suspicious, and I’m wondering if I’m missing something.",6,6,0,"Welcome to /r/ask_politics.

Ask_Politics,hot,Is it possible to use a 14th Amendment Interstate Compact to avoid a debt ceiling standoff?,"I’ve been thinking ahead to the 2026 midterms and the final two years of President Trump’s term. What worries me the most is a full-blown debt ceiling standoff, government shutdown, and economic crisis.

Historically, when we have a divided government, we get the usual brinkmanship. Lawmakers hold the economy hostage for political points, and then — at the last possible second — they raise the ceiling like they were always going to. The system barely holds together.

But Trump doesn’t play by those rules. He doesn’t answer to Congress. He doesn’t respond to public pressure. If he wanted to tank the economy and blame Democrats for it, he could simply let the country default — and he might.

So I started thinking: What if we didn’t have to wait for Washington to do its job?

About 26 states allow citizen-initiated ballot measures. The idea is to coordinate across those states to introduce ballot initiatives to form and join a 14th Amendment Fiscal Responsibility Interstate Compact.

If the federal government defaults on its debt, all member states would trigger an emergency statewide split-rate tax to pay federal obligations from within the state until the crisis is resolved.

In plain terms: if the federal government won’t do its damn job, then we will do it for them.

The compact is named in the spirit of Section 4 of the 14th Amendment, which states that the validity of the public debt “shall not be questioned.”

We could start with Florida and encourage other states to follow.

I don’t care who takes the blame for a future default. I just don’t trust the current government enough to feel confident that they won’t destroy the economy on purpose. Again.

Curious what others here think. Not sure what the implications are regarding a confederalist safety net like this or the feasibility or deadlines of getting something like this onto the ballot in time for the midterms",1,1,0,"Welcome to /r/ask_politics.

Curious what others here think. Not sure what the implications are regarding a confederalist safety net like this or the feasibility or deadlines of getting something like this onto the ballot in time for the midterms",1,1,0,"Almost certainly not for a few reasons.

First off, many states don't have mass fiscal resources due to having lower taxes and obligations. Some states *do* have multi-billion dollar budgets, but that money also comes from the federal government in part via block grant programs. Therefore, asking states to pay the massive 880 billion in interest upkeep with relatively meager budgets that would be impacted by a shutdown is infeasible.

Additionally, this would likely be an extremely hard sell to the states that generally pay more in than they receive from the federal government. [At least using 2023 figures](https://usafacts.org/articles/which-states-contribute-the-most-and-least-to-federal-revenue/), Florida, Texas, New York, New Jersey, California, Illinois, and Ohio all would likely balk at the government they net-contribute relying on them to contribute *more* to deal with the debt that *they* racked up. 

Finally, there's a good chance this is unconstitutional. Article 1 Section 8 clearly states ""The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts... of the United States,"" which carries a strong implication that the states would not have the power to pay the Debts of the United States. The 10th Amendment seems to support this, as ""The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people"" would likely be interpreted to mean that, due to the United States Congress having sole financial power in the U.S. government, an interstate compact to pay the debts of the United States would be unconstitutional.

So, due to a lack of resources, political will, and constitutional viability, it's almost certainly impossible. Very interesting idea though!",1,2025-06-22 22:20:47,2025-09-24 15:25:04,0

Ask_Politics,hot,Executive Orders are not laws...,"On Wednesday, February 5th, 2025, Trump signed the ""No Men in Women's Sports"" EO and the White House agenda referred to the action as signing it ""into law"". To my knowledge, EO's carry the weight of law in the absence of an existing law being in effect, but it's not a law. And we regularly see EOs be challenged legally. There's a distinction there that it seems needs to be made.

Is there any precedent of past administrations using this language referring to EOs? If not, should this be viewed as concerning?

Democrats and Republicans were big-tent parties with Progressive and Conservative factions. Republicans, after the Civil War, while taking the ""left"" stance on Reconstruction and Civil Rights,  very quickly became associated with Northern Business interests. Democrats took the mantle of ""populism."" 

The Progressive movement within both the Republican and Democratic parties vied for the vote of the urban working class, while Democrats increasingly embraced the populist concerns of midwestern farmers (along with their white southern base). The Democrats also developed close ties to""white ethnics,"" Jewish, Irish, Italian, and, to a lesser extent, Germans. This coalition,  white ethnics,  some portion of the working class, and anyone annoyed with whoever the Republican president was quickly became a majority in NYC

People also voted for more based on the relationships they had with local politicians and the Tammany Hall Society, which ran NYC politics for about a hundred years from around the 1860s to the 1940s and was close with the Democratic party

Democrats built loyalty through aid and policies like the New Deal, while the city’s liberal, educated vibe keeps it blue. GOP wins (like Giuliani) are rare and usually moderate.

I'd also throw in a bit more opinion sites, especially those that tend to update their news more frequently.  Again, both sides so you can get an idea of what each is focusing on.

Not so much daily tracking, but I’ve found the following two Australian resources incredibly helpful.    
In-depth analysis and background on a topic, cutting out all of the ‘crazy’ [no offence intended]  

I found both incredibly valuable, since the Australian public broadcaster has no as and is taxpayer funded:    Means they don’t need hyperbole and aren’t beholden to corporate interests.   
The whole prob of attracting or ticking off advertisers doesn’t arise.   

Both are a lot more down to earth than most free U.S. outlets:   I’ve found YouTube vids to have super-hyperbolic titles ….. and then I wasted like half an hour watching something that was fairly uninformed I’ve and underwhelming. 😢 

Maybe have a look at the two shows below, see if either might be helpful:  

_’Planet America’_

(And I say this as a Floridian and a Democrat who finds Rubio to be the most spineless excuse for someone who loves to claim he's on moral high ground) By that measure, Rubio isn't a particularly controversial pick.

On a political level, you have to choose your battles - while sure maybe it didn't have to be unanimous, politicians need to face the reality of the situation on how many nominations they can realistically fight and how many they can even oppose if they pass.

CBP collects tariffs as goods enter the United States. The company exporting that goods pays the fee, but they pay it by increasing the costs of their goods by a corresponding amount. So, they charge 25% more, and CBP collects that money from them when the food enters a port of entry.

Tariffs are basically a tax on the consumer. You are paying the company more, who then pays CBP.

",7,6,1,"This is not a matter of a Constitutional Amendment. It's a matter of overturning a Supreme Court ruling. In Obergerfell v.

The SC is always within its power to overturn a previous decision (although, in theory, they are only supposed to do it very rarely).

Ask_Politics,hot,Would Idaho actually be able to make marriage a matter of the states?,"Okay, I didn't pay much attention in government class. Or I just got the wrong messaging from it. But from what I understood, constitutional amendments are kind of impossible to overturn. Or maybe not impossible but just too difficult to even try and overturn.

But for some reason in the year of 2025, the state of Idaho wants to overturn marriage rights and make it a state matter. I could be absolutely wrong but I know that the matter falls under the 14th amendment in some form.

Could someone just give me some very basic explanation as why Idaho thinks it is a possibility to do this?

All the more bizarre because no one else seems to talk about it.

Yesterday, with Donald Trump giving a speech, was just the latest example of this (though in this case they happened to pick a particularly good looking one). And. while white males are also placed along with them, you rarely ever see white females put in such positions nowadays.  And this is done completely regardless of whether they're attractive or not.

Ask_Politics,hot,Why does the president have so much pomp?,"I am watching the inauguration and am struck by home much pomp there is. 

This is despite the very foundation of the presidents role being the antithesis of the monarchy in the UK, and the founding fathers of wanting to avoid any type of monarchy in the US. 

From the introduction of the presidents and them ‘being escorted’ by Members of congress. How they all have titles such as ‘the honourable’, the amount of music and ceremony surrounding was is essentially the swearing of an oath of office (the only stipulation in the constitution). Not to mention the use of a bible to swear the oath (considering they are a ‘secular’ country).

How did the ceremonial / pomp come to be? And how do they justify this considering the founding fathers really didn’t want / in-vision this?

Ask_Politics,hot,Was the Australian Federal Election of 2022 a ‘Political Realignment’ ,"Whilst I’m sure most people are aware of what this is, a ‘Political Realignment’ is when “is a set of sharp changes in party related ideology, issues, leaders, regional bases, demographic bases, and/or the structure of powers within a government” (Wikipedia). Either people change their voting substantially or the parties themselves change. 

In the 2022 Australian Federal Election, the ‘Teal Independents’ took over 6 Liberal seats in inner city suburbs, adding to Zali Steggall’s seat in Sydney. Currently they hold collectively 7 seats in the House of Representatives, 4 in Sydney, 2 in Melbourne and 1 in Perth. 

These seats for decades formed the base of the Liberal Party and prior conservative counterparts, often being held on substantial margins and almost always winning more than 50% of the popular vote (therefore not needing to rely on preferences). 

These seats are typically much wealthier seats, in fact most of them (if not all) are in the top 10 wealthiest federal divisions in Australia. And I should know I live in one of them. Apparently these electorates are fiscally conservative or liberal, and socially progressive. To an EXTENT, that is true. 

None of the ‘Teal Independents’ seats are held on high margins. And apart from Steggall’s seat in Sydney, all of the Liberals won the popular vote (but lost on preferences. A large part of why they lost is that some people chose the ‘Teal Independent’ as a tactical vote to remove the Liberal candidate (that is also, to an EXTENT, true, as the Labor and Greens vote declined in these seats). But many also changed from voting liberal. 

As someone who even lives in one of these seats, I don’t even know myself whether the Liberals would ever have a shot at these seats again. The liberals got trounced in the cities in 2022 but comparatively did quite well in regional and rural areas. 

Is this the beginning of a political realignment in which the liberals can only form government through outer suburbs and the rural and regional areas? Or was this a setback which they can come back from? ",3,3,0,"Welcome to /r/ask_politics.

Some quotes:

**American voters are less ideologically polarized than they think they are, and that misperception is greatest for the most politically engaged people**. 

However, most partisans hold major misbeliefs about the other party’s preferences that lead them to think there is far less shared policy belief. This perception gap is highest among progressive activists, followed closely by extreme conservatives: in other words, the people who are most involved in civic and political life hold the least accurate views of the other side’s beliefs. Figure 1 shows the gap between what groups of Americans think the other side believes and what they self-report believing, as of 2019.

**American politicians are highly ideologically polarized. In other words, they believe in and vote for different sets of policies, with little overlap. This trend has grown in a steady, unpunctuated manner for decades.** 

One reason that the most highly politically engaged Americans may misunderstand the other side is that they correctly estimate the extreme ideological polarization among politicians. 

While at this point, candidates and parties may be responding to polarized primary voters, candidates and parties have been driving the polarization, and not all voters are ideologically polarized. 

The disparity between where leaders are ideologically and where their voters are precludes legislative policy agreement on many issues. Average voters are not able to assert their (often weak) policy preferences because they do not have an effective way to vote out representatives who do not accurately represent their constituents’ views, particularly on the right where party chairs are likely to substitute one extreme candidate for another.

**Even though Americans are not as ideologically polarized as they believe themselves to be, they** ***are*** **emotionally polarized (known as “affective polarization”). In other words, they do not like members of the other party.** 

Americans harbor strong dislike for members of the other party (though they also dislike their own parties, as well). While social media is often blamed for this phenomenon, affective polarization started growing before the internet: its onset more closely correlates with the rise of cable news and radio talk shows.

**Similarly, affective polarization is not causing political violence directly. It is probably contributing to an environment that allows politicians and opinion leaders to increase violence targeted at politicians, election officials, women, and many types of minorities.** 

Affective polarization in the United States has been rising for decades, while political violence only increased sharply in 2016. Affective polarization is also quite symmetrical across parties, while political violence is overwhelmingly from the right. This suggests that emotional feelings of hatred toward members of the other party are not a primary cause of political violence. ",15,2025-01-05 06:03:44,2025-01-05 22:47:14,0

You just need to understand your stance on the issues you care about and be able to talk about that stance competently. It's okay to not have a stance on issues that are important to other people. It's also okay to change your stance when exposed to new information.

The idea that you need to categorize yourself into a certain ideological bucket is a propaganda method meant to get you to identify with the more palatable aspects of an ideology so you are more likely to agree with the less palatable aspects of that ideology. It also gets you emotionally invested in defending aspects of that ideology when presented with contradictory evidence.

When political scientists categorize people into ideology groups, it's a method of describing behavior. When people start identifying with those descriptors, it becomes a method of prescribing behavior and enforcing it on other people.

You don't need to play that game. You can be a perfectly well informed politically invested individual and not identify with any ideology. Eventually, you might accept an identity as a description of your beliefs, but you don't need to tie yourself to that identity. If you are pro-widget and are called a widgetist, it's okay to call youself a widgetist. It's also okay to stop calling yourself a widgetist when other people who call themselves widgetists start believing in something you don't believe in.

Whatever you do, don't go chasing political compass or its derivatives.

Even though each political label has a culture surrounding it, the fact is that these ideologies are more like a constellation of common viewpoints than something monolithic. There's a lot of variation in there. It's like a bunch of different variables united by a generally similar set of values and not so much a uniform thing.

If you want to dig in a little bit on what the major political parties in the US believe, I'd recommend a data-driven approach. As in, take a look at some polls about where voters in each party stand. This will give you a cleaner idea of what people believe, without the heavy editorialization you can often find in places like YouTube. Of course, feel free to read/watch/listen to as much editorialization as you want but sometimes it's hard to sort out the facts from partisan rhetoric.

So why don't the states just impose higher taxes on the wealthy to fund their programs and infrastructure projects?",27,22,5,"The problem that is often cited is the fear of wealthy citizens simply leading the state. The [Fourteenth Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/amendment-14/section-1/) protects the right to move from one state to another. There is some amount of research into this topic, some suggesting that overall trends lead to outflow of wealthy citizens with increased income taxes. [Shocker: Wealthy Americans tend to flee high-income tax states](https://www.investmentnews.com/tax/shocker-wealthy-americans-tend-to-flee-high-income-tax-states/251879) (citing [The Introduction of the Income Tax, Fiscal Capacity, and Migration: Evidence from US States](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20210388)). Other studies have concluded that this is actually a minority factor in citizen movement, focusing on employment opportunities as a more powerful driver. [State Taxes Have a Minimal Impact on People’s Interstate Moves](https://www.cbpp.org/research/state-budget-and-tax/state-taxes-have-a-minimal-impact-on-peoples-interstate-moves). 

A wealth tax is new territory though, because we're talking about taxing people based on assets as opposed to income, Elizabeth Warren's proposal for example proposes an increased tax only on households with more than 50 million in assets, approximately the wealthiest 75,000 households. [Ultra-Millionaire Tax](https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/ultra-millionaire-tax). You didn't ask about the efficacy of these taxes and/or implementation, so I'm not going to touch on the nuance of the plans; that plan is a good example though, tax the absolute wealth-hoarders and leave everyone else untouched. 

If the Federal Government implemented such a plan, it's likely that the math would work out (depending on the proposal) that for *some* percentage of the ultra-wealthy population, it would make more sense to simply leave the country and not pay. Some are dual citizens and could renounce, others could renounce their citizenship and seek residency in one of the nations that allows investment residency/citizenship. Would anyone actually do that? we don't know, it depends on the individuals and the specific plan. It's tough to extricate yourself from a country, and it's tough to extricate yourself from the U.S. economy. These are the people who have the easiest time (financially) abandoning the country, but simultaneously some of the largest headaches (financially) when doing so. 

If a State Government implemented such a plan, the math of moving would probably be more appetizing for a LOT more people. There is no application process for moving a domicile. There is no need to shield assets, if you live somewhere else, the tax just doesn't apply. There is no need to stop doing business in the U.S.,  liquidate assets, or stop vacationing in your home state.  It would be appetizing to simply buy a home in another state, pretend to live there, and fraudulently establish the domicile. Obviously, I'm not condoning that behavior, and it wouldn't be legal, but it's practical. It's a lot easier to claim you live in Mississippi than to claim you live in Spain. 

You'll notice the last two paragraphs don't have citations, and that's because this is highly theoretical. We know the effect increased taxes have on movement between states. It's at least *a* factor, even if you don't agree it's *the* factor; in either case, the correlation is there. A wealth tax on the ultra-wealthiest by a state may or may not make citizens flee, but the calculation to do so would be far in their favor when compared to a federal tax. That's a legitimate political fear.",9,2024-12-26 04:04:36,2024-12-26 21:58:12,0.40

It seems unlikely (to me) that this will happen because internal mobility in the U.S. can't be restricted. The article suggests that people are making the argument that the wealthy continue to live in high-tax states despite high income taxes, but that's pretty dubious Jeff Bezos legally lives in Florrida now, Elon Musk in Texas. Bill Gates and Larry Ellison have property in Florida and in order to be Florida residents for tax purposes they'd just have to spend more time there, which I'm guessing is not a huge hardship. It might not be worth moving for a few percent of annual income (after rich people deductions) but probably almost universally would be for a percent or two of your net worth per year.",1,2024-12-26 04:04:36,2024-12-27 02:41:57,-0.5

You wouldn't even need to do that.  Establishing residence in another state is, frankly, easy.  Get a new place, change mailing address, get a new DL, open new bank accounts in that new state.  That can be done in a matter of a week.  The old residence can either be sold or rented out.  And if you're moving due to a wealth tax, you probably aren't doing much except house shopping and letting your accountant/lawyer do the rest.  What's a few dozen thousand dollars of billable hours if it saves you multiple of that per year?

Being a supermajority chamber, it means the Senate gets bogged down easily with how long it takes to pass individual bills. Even ones that are extremely popular.

Ask_Politics,hot,Trump Pushes To End DST. Will It Actually Happen?,"[https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-says-will-seek-eliminate-daylight-saving-time-rcna184193](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-says-will-seek-eliminate-daylight-saving-time-rcna184193)

And even more importantly, what has stopped it from happening already?

It's been pushed before and it always seems to be bipartisan. I'm pretty sure the US population mostly hates having to switch times too yet it always seem to get stopped. The last push was the Sunshine Protection Act but it died in the House after unanimous approval by the Senate, but it was to keep DST permanent rather than eliminating it.

Perhaps there is a split between eliminating DST and keeping it permanent? I know we did permanent DST before under Nixon and that didn't work out.

I am personally for eliminating it and sleep scientists seem to agree. I would hope that Congress doesn't squabble about and delay doing something that most of us would welcome.

Since they're in charge of the campaign laws, they place all sorts of formal and informal constraints around individuals and groups in terms of the entry requirements to even get put on a ballot.

But also, on another level, they create a situation where voters and political candidates alike are in a bit of a [prisoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma). Things like [first past the post voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting), gerrymandering, voter obstruction laws, the [electoral college](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College), and institutional inertia favor an ""all or nothing"" partisan power structure.

As a voter, the only way you can ensure you get what you want is if you either vote all Democrat or all Republican, depending on your political leanings. And this is deliberate. This dynamic is by design and it ensures the two party duopoly remains intact.

Even the three branch structure of government itself favours the partisan duopoly. The way the US government is structured, POTUS is always the head of their partisan organization, in addition to being the head of state, the head of cabinet agencies, the head of foreign policy, and the head of the armed forces. That's a lot of incumbent authority to place in the hands of one of only two parties every election cycle. Also, any party with a simple majority in Congress wields incredible power over the minority party, since they can simply gridlock any proposed legislation at a procedural and committee level before it even reaches the assembly for consideration.

Even the judicial branch contributes to this, somewhat. Because SCOTUS is not beholden to the other two branches after a Justice is confirmed at the Senate level, anytime a party manages to stuff it with ideologically right or left justices, the court will be a partisan force in favour of one particular ideology or another potentially for decades, even if the popular will has shifted substantially.

Parties also make sure that people within their own ranks can't reasonably deviate from the party line, which further supresses diversity of choice at the ballot box. The candidates you are allowed to choose from were selected by secret committees, beholden to special interests. American voters are only given the choice between two candidates, both of whom have been vetted by society's elites in advance, and so in a way your vote doesn't really matter. Whoever gets in power is generally going to do whatever the plutocracy wants, first and foremost, and then secondly, whatever the partisan institution wants. What voters want is a tertiary consideration at best. And it's within this context that both Democrats and Republicans have worked together to ensure that they're the only parties who will have a meaningful shot at achieving power in US elections.

Parliamentary systems and proportional systems, on the other hand, tend to be multi-party systems and are more politically moderate and reflective of the overall population's will, since they are more closely centered around consensus and compromise. The executive can also be subject to a no confidence vote in these systems, so they have to be more sensitive to what the people around them want. And the judicial branch in a parliamentary system is beholden to the elected government rather than its own partisan whims, irrespective of what the public wishes.

The Founders believed that any government where authority is not derived from the will of the majority is illegitimate. Our system at every level is designed to ensure that a few people get their way, while any deviation from the status quo line is suppressed before it even has a chance to be discussed. Food for thought about what it means to actually live in the ""Land of the Free.""",7,2024-12-11 17:30:43,2024-12-12 00:11:51,0.5

This is the Republican Coalition:

2024: white Christians, white voters without a college degree. veterans, rural voters, married men

If anyone thinks I'm an idiot I not only will not be offended but will welcome the opportunity to learn something from better minds than mine.

I have been interested in this question for decades now. The big shift in the coalitions that form the two parties occurred [between FDR and Nixon](https://www.studentsofhistory.com/ideologies-flip-Democratic-Republican-parties), but the parties have continued to evolve since then and we seem to be in the middle of another realignment right now as the working class moves from the Democrats over to the Republican camp.  

After Nixon, we had the transition between Reagan and Clinton when Clinton (in response to Reagan's landslide) shifted the Democratic party to the right from [Liberal to Neo-Liberal](https://news.ucsb.edu/2024/021387/historian-nelson-lichtenstein-clinton-betrayed-progressives-capitulated-right).  Today the Republicans are following suit in response to Obama's popularity by shifting again, which you can see in the [Gallup polling](https://news.gallup.com/poll/388781/political-party-preferences-shifted-greatly-during-2021.aspx), but I'm not sure where too. Democrats OTOH are on their back foot.  They are being reacted to by the general population, but have not yet reached the point of redefining themselves and explaining what they stand for and then selling that to the modern age. What I mostly hear from the political left today is ""of course we are right, we have always been right"" but a lot of the nation has forgotten what that even means.  

For me, the coalitions that make up the two parties today fall into four groups:

Fringe groups that don't really have a choice. These groups are actually outliers but each party points to them as representative of what the other part stands for:

Republican | Democrat
:--|:--
White nationalists | Communists 
Militia groups | Anti-Capitalists (e.g. Antifa)

Less government vs. More government groups represent what has been the core principles of each party, but may be shifting given the past few elections. 

Republican | Democrat
:--|:--
Rural | Urban 
Libertarians | Green Party
Small business | Unions

Social issue groups are close to ""single issue"" groups but beyond that try to define their world view as American and any other view as Unamerican or deviant.

Republican | Democrat
:--|:--
Christian Family values | Minority rights (e.g. Trans / Atheist groups) 
Pro-Life | Pro-Choice
Law & Order | Racial Justice / BLM

Single issue groups are endless. I have a much easier time coming up ones that align with the Democratic party than the Republicans, but the largest I can think of are these:

Republican | Democrat
:--|:--
Less Regulations | Global Warming 
Lower Taxes | Universal basic income

The Clinton point is fascinating, really, yes Reagan and Carter were the first ""Neoliberals"" I feel, but Clinton's ascension and influence in the Democratic party I think plays a huge part in the refusal for the Democrats to move away from Neoliberalism, I had always thought Clinton was a neolib from the start, I did not know he was running on some progressive issues, Republicans have been far better at adapting to political tide shifts IMO, with the southern strategy as their basis, they've modified and modernized their messaging and it's proven effective.

Ask_Politics,hot,Why is the International Community Supporting HTS in the Syrian Conflict Despite Its Terrorist Links?,"Hello everyone,

I’ve been following the developments in the Syrian civil war and I’m curious about the role of Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a group with known historical ties to al-Qaeda and ISIS. HTS has gained significant ground and influence, yet it appears that some international voices seem supportive or at least less critical of their advancements.

Given their background as a terrorist organization, why would there be this shift in attitude? Are there geopolitical reasons behind this seeming support, or is it more about a lesser evil mindset compared to the Assad regime? What are the implications for Syria’s future and regional stability if HTS consolidates power?

I’d appreciate any insights or perspectives on this complex issue. Thanks!

Sorry if that seems like a lot of questions, but the recent events in Korea had me thinking about this. ",56,54,2,"The answer is kind of. The US lacks the same constitutional provisions as South Korea for martial law, it's simply not in the constitution. Martial law has been particularly enacted in the US before but it has generally tested the limits of the constitution. The closest is the insurrection act which allows the president to use the military to restore order.

In terms of arresting congress, Article I, Section 6, Clause 1 of the constitution says that senators and representatives ""shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same."" So if the president follows the law he would need to indite members of Congress to arrest them which would be a long process and require a grand jury. Of course if the president does anything illegal the Supreme Court can say that's it's illegal but they can't really enforce that ruling if the president does not cooperate. Basically if the president tries to take power and ignore the constitution we can't rely on the constitution to protect us. The military would have to not follow illegal orders and/or mass protests and/or actions from the governor's.

In terms of other questions Congress probably can't override any martial law deceleration, the process would take to long. Any attempt to do so would be subjected to a veto. The congress can convene outside the capital. And if there's a supermajority in Congress that wants to impeach the president they can do it very fast.

It was understanding the Section 5 Clause 4 prevented Congress from meeting anywhere but the Capitol without the consent of the other House; this would certainly complicate things. Would a resolution that granted authority to meet outside the Capitol need to be taken in the Captiol in the first place-as such a resolution would need to have legal force; the constitution stating they have to meet in the Capitol would seem like that resolution would be null? ",1,2024-12-05 18:38:03,2024-12-11 16:23:43,0

That's kind of a bad example [because that government just collapsed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/05/what-happens-next-now-france-government-has-fallen-explainer).  And that government was formed that way to prevent the largest party in the government from [having control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_France).

Trump has said, for example, that we might need a [tariff (and more)](https://apnews.com/article/us-steel-nippon-trump-biden-steelworkers-1b0fb38077ff0a6b68e64a184f270bac) on cheap, foreign sources of steel in order to protect our domestic production - and blocking the acquisition of US Steel by Nippon Steel.  The goal of this is to strength the domestic steel industry, which is very unionized and in traditional ""blue"" areas.  If they'd stop reflexively opposing *everything* Trump says, we'd be better off.

And that said, the same is true with MAGA and Biden/the Left.  The utter insistence that the only stimulus that should be given is their version and basically bailing on any negotiation *has* to stop.  It leads to *horrible* situations and is basically just making the Presidency stronger - which is going to be to their benefit soon, but eventually the other party gets control!  People tend to forget that in their dreams of Red Waves or a Permanent Majority.",1,2024-12-05 14:24:11,2024-12-05 17:52:08,-0.2

",11,11,0,"There's a few questions in here that I'm going to parse out. 

* Can the president create tariffs? 

Yes, but you're not alone in being confused. The Constitution gives taxation powers to Congress in Article I, Section 8, ""Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises."" However, as you can see from [this wikipedia article on Trump's tariffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_tariffs#Legality), Congress passed two laws in the 70s saying that the president can create tariffs. Some of that appears to be in dispute but not enormously so. 

* What are the limits of executive orders? 

Consider that the president's job is to execute the laws that Congress has passed. Congress has passed laws that give the president the ability to create tariffs, the president can then execute Congress's will by creating whatever tariffs they see fit. 

The broader issue is that Congress has ceded more and more of its legislative authority to the president over the preceding decades. The reason why is complicated and beyond what can be adequately explained by me, but it can be summed up with partisan gridlock and a slow to react legislature.",13,2024-11-27 20:21:08,2024-11-28 03:17:30,0

In October, [a plurality of polled voters (42%)](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25252151/cnn-poll-on-2024-presidential-race.pdf) stated they had no strong opinions one way or the other on trans issues. That was after the Republican campaign placed about $100 million dollars down on vehemently anti-trans ads.

In November - after the election - voter attitudes switched to [a plurality (43%)](https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2024/11/21/dddbb/3), but only when the answer mentioned ""upholding traditional definitions of gender."" The particular problem there is I don't really like how that answer is worded - transgender people are not some kind of special third gender. They just identify as male or female. Nonetheless I think most people who answer 'yes' to that would be nominally anti-trans in some way.

Pretty much all the polling illustrating anti-trans attitudes among Independent voters comes after the election already occurred - so a early-to-late November timeframe. Prior to that, support splits relatively neatly along party lines. 

I think what people are struggling with here is *ex post facto justification* for voting for Trump. A lot of Independents were clearly intending to vote for Trump the entire time, but need to vocalize some kind of justification that makes them come off as more persuadable than they actually are. I've witnessed this in-person quite a lot since the campaign kicked off - many people wanted Trump for a variety of reasons, but don't want to articulate exactly why that is, so they make up a plausible reason that they suddenly 'switched.' The reality is that research shows time and time again - American voters are not persuaded by ads. They don't watch them and don't make up their minds based on single ads. [It entirely depends on the frequency of their exposure to many, many ads, and their larger information system.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01487-4) More so than that one ad, the anti-trans *campaign* run by the Republican party and their enthusiastic backers running important digital platforms such as Elon Musk affected voters over time and boosted turnout enough to get the barest points necessary for a win. 

I'll say I've never actually met someone that solely voted for something based on anti-trans rights. They're almost always hiding other beliefs that they just aren't comfortable vocalizing to someone they don't think will reciprocate.

Hope that provides some clarity. Can't answer on how other ads compare; would say in 2016 we saw a very similar information environment in regard to Trump voters and digital advertising.",1,2024-11-27 09:08:08,2024-11-28 15:23:40,0.7

However, if the ad was effective , It was effective because it highlighted and reminded people that in first few years of their reign, the Biden Harris team steam rolled ahead on matters/ topics that most citizens don’t understand ( TQIAplus, DEI) in law and policies and has in fact made their lives more difficult while also prioritizing non-US Americans and other identity politics issues over issues and real world struggles (like the economy, safety, free speech) that many were concerned with. The Dems also say they did great with economy. Well, Then they did a horrible job communicating that which is another thing the ad did well. 

Dems being horrible at communicating their priorities and successes is also what the ad did well. It highlighted Harris’ crap communication in interviews and town halls. Is trans surgeries for felons a priority to the Dems? If not then why is this one of clearest stance quotes gotten from Harris during the whole campaign (that interview itself was not during the campaign but that is also part of the point) while Harris was too vague on solid action and policies and in all her interview history?

[https://www.lwv.org/blog/whats-so-bad-about-voter-id-laws](https://www.lwv.org/blog/whats-so-bad-about-voter-id-laws)  
  
There's a few issues:  
1. Government issued photo IDs are not given out freely. Young voters who live in cities or on school campuses often don't have need to get a photo ID, so there's no point in applying for one. If you don't need to drive anywhere, you don't need to get a license. And if you're not planning to leave the country, you don't need a passport. 

Similarly, these forms of ID are not automatically updated with your address when you move. In the US, elections are conducted explicitly based on where you live, with districts cutting between neighborhoods. (There are no ""presidential elections"", just deciding how your state should vote.) So, if the ID you got when you were 18 says you live in Dallas, but you're trying to vote a year later after you moved to San Antonio, you're not going to be allowed to vote with a strong voter ID law-or at best, you'll get a provisional ballot which likely won't be counted anyway.

Changing these IDs is not an unbearable burden, but it's also not trivial. There's a fee associated and you have to spend hours at the DMV(letters vary by state, but it's essentially the place that handles photo IDs for driver's licenses), which are notoriously slow and culturally understood to be the height of bureaucratic slowness. Since most people don't get paid for taking time off and it occurs during a workday, AND most people under the age of 30 move more frequently, it's a process that not only costs the fees, but the time spent AND the time not earning wages.

2. Voter ID is pitched to solve the problem of a very specific type of fraud-that of someone claiming to be someone they're not at the poll. Impersonation voter fraud is not at all a problem in any real sense. Like, it literally happens less than once out of every million ballots cast. And every election board in the country has provisional ballots to ensure that someone's vote is not counted twice or stolen.   
  
3. Having a government issued photo ID as the requirement pulls in the opposite direction of vote by mail and in so doing, creates a structure that suppresses voter turnout. Voting in the US is conducted on one day that is not treated as a holiday (although more states have been doing imperfect early voting). A law making it mandated to vote in person, with your ID has all of the problems of the first point above and actively reduces votes for people who 1) are out of the country, 2) working/doing childcare during the week 3) have mobility issues or illness on the voting day(s). 

In sum, at it's best, good faith interpretation mandatory voter ID is a solution to a problem that doesn't actually exist and in actual practice it's designed to suppress votes.",23,2024-11-24 14:11:13,2024-11-24 17:17:03,0.9
Ask_Politics,top,"As a foreigner, I am curious about why does the Democratic Party object to Voter Identification with a Photo ID?",A photo ID requirement is almost universal in the rest World. Why is this a big deal in the US?,87,66,21,"In Florida, the drivers license is $48, replacement copies (or ID cards) are $25. To get the initial voter approved copy here are the required documents that have to be brought to the government office in person: https://www.flhsmv.gov/driver-licenses-id-cards/what-to-bring/u-s-citizen/

Every time you move to a new address, a replacement is required within 30 days.

 Every time you change your name (marriage/divorce), you have to bring those documents in person. 

The offices in less affluent areas are packed, sometimes inconveniently located, only open during conventional working hours, and with an appointment can still take over an hour.

They expire every 10 years, though replacement copies can be ordered online if you have a credit/debit card. 

 To the average person that sounds simple enough, but to the poor who are more likely to have less stable housing & financial situations? The elderly who no longer need to drive? Anyone who lives in a remote location and/or is barely scraping by? Those required documents are also not cheap or easy to replace if lost and mostly unnecessary otherwise, so many just go without.

 If the ID was free and provided by the government it would be far simpler, as they have that information and you would just have to show up to verify it.",9,2024-11-24 14:11:13,2024-11-24 19:45:55,0.6

Man, I've been saying this for quite a while now: there needs to be a point where a certain monetary value is taxed 99%. Do we want millionaires to exist but not $100-million millionaires and up? There's our cutoff. Do we want to allow $999,999,999.99 to exist but not above? There's our cutoff.

* Polling methods have improved since 2016 (and because of it).
* Hillary was a poor choice. Of the 20 candidates fielded by the major parties in the 2016 primaries (17 Republican, 3 Democratic), the nominees ended up being the two with the *lowest* net approval ratings. Harris' net approval is higher than Hillary's was.
* Trump was an unknown quantity in 2016. Once he was known, he lost in 2020.
* Hillary ran a poor campaign. Given the shortened timeframe, Harris has run a much better campaign. 
* Trump's 2016 victory was marked by a lot of new Republican voter registration. People registered for the first time just to vote for him. Although this statistic isn't frequently cited, it's especially important, because people who take the time to register in a given cycle have a higher propensity to vote. New [Democratic voter registration has outpaced the Republicans](https://pentagroup.com/insight/state-snapshot-the-surge-in-newly-registered-voters) in the key swing states that will decide the election this year.
* [Early voting in the three ""blue wall"" states](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-elections/early-vote) favors registered Democrats. If Harris wins those states, she's highly likely to win the election.

None of this means Harris will win. Everyone needs to get out and vote. But if you're only looking for positive signs, those are some.",102,2024-10-31 17:45:50,2024-10-31 20:23:34,0.6

Sorry if that seems like a lot of questions, but the recent events in Korea had me thinking about this. ",55,53,2,"The answer is kind of. The US lacks the same constitutional provisions as South Korea for martial law, it's simply not in the constitution. Martial law has been particularly enacted in the US before but it has generally tested the limits of the constitution. The closest is the insurrection act which allows the president to use the military to restore order.

In terms of arresting congress, Article I, Section 6, Clause 1 of the constitution says that senators and representatives ""shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same."" So if the president follows the law he would need to indite members of Congress to arrest them which would be a long process and require a grand jury. Of course if the president does anything illegal the Supreme Court can say that's it's illegal but they can't really enforce that ruling if the president does not cooperate. Basically if the president tries to take power and ignore the constitution we can't rely on the constitution to protect us. The military would have to not follow illegal orders and/or mass protests and/or actions from the governor's.

In terms of other questions Congress probably can't override any martial law deceleration, the process would take to long. Any attempt to do so would be subjected to a veto. The congress can convene outside the capital. And if there's a supermajority in Congress that wants to impeach the president they can do it very fast.

It was understanding the Section 5 Clause 4 prevented Congress from meeting anywhere but the Capitol without the consent of the other House; this would certainly complicate things. Would a resolution that granted authority to meet outside the Capitol need to be taken in the Captiol in the first place-as such a resolution would need to have legal force; the constitution stating they have to meet in the Capitol would seem like that resolution would be null? ",1,2024-12-05 18:38:03,2024-12-11 16:23:43,0

Thanks in advance.",55,42,13,"From a logistical standpoint, there are a couple things that stick out.

The biggest for me is that by winning this time, Trump will be able to replace several Supreme Court justices--Alito, Thomas, and possibly Roberts. He will likely replace them with very young people, which ensure that the Court would remain conservative-leaning for many decades to come. The first time Trump was elected, the implications for the Court were bad, but they were fixable within the next decade or so. At this point, Trump's election basically ensures that liberal legislation will be struck down by the courts for the rest of my life. Even if the Democrats find a way to win back Congress and pass legislation, the Supreme Court won't uphold most of it.

Second, there's a lot less Republican resistance to Trump this time around. Last time, Paul Ryan controlled the House, and the Senate Republican coalition was very anti-Trump. This ensured that they wouldn't even bring up a lot of the stuff that Trump wanted to do for a vote in the House or Senate. This time, the coalitions are a lot friendlier to his priorities, and he has more control over them. He also appointed a *lot* of judges to the lower-level courts during his first presidency, which means a lot less friction for his legislative goals in general.

Third, in 2016 a lot of people convinced themselves that Trump's presidency was a fluke. We didn't know what his presidency looked like, and he didn't win the popular vote, so it was easy for people to believe that this wasn't the will of the voters. This time it clearly is, even though they know exactly what a Trump presidency will look like. That's hard for a lot of people to accept.

However ... I guess I don't really agree with the premise that people are going more bananas over this election than 2016. At least among people I know, they were *much* more shocked and upset in 2016. The reaction this year is pretty muted compared to how bad it was then.",149,2024-11-12 18:50:16,2024-11-12 19:32:58,0.6

Thanks in advance.",55,42,13,"Do you perhaps live in a place with a parliamentary system?

The President has a lot of power in the US and party loyalties are very strong right now. In 2016, Trump campaigned as a demogogue, but people didn't really know how he would govern. He didn't know either, which is why he staffed his administration with a lot of experienced, mainstream Republicans.

Since then, the party has been purged of almost all its traditionalists. They've all been driven out, either reputationally or electorally. The biggest symbol of this shift is the change from Mike Pence to JD Vance as the Vice President, but there are many others as well. Trump's daughter in-law is co-chair of the party now. Anyone who might serve as a check on his authoritarian instincts is gone and won't be coming back.

Simultaneously, Trump knows how to work the levers of power much better now. In 2016, he had never even held elected office. Now, he's been President for four years and has been shoring up his political support since then. He'll be much more capable of enacting his agenda.

And for the opposition, his agenda is scary. In his first term, he appointed Supreme Court justices (they serve for life) who not only overturned rights people feel are fundamental, but also ruled that the President has much broader immunity than most people previously thought he had, giving Trump carte blanche to push the boundaries of what we traditionally found acceptable. His loyalty-tested majorities in both houses of Congress won't stop him.

He has also promised to take significantly more severe actions this time around. He's repeatedly made physical threats against his political opponents, which he didn't do in 2016. And when he was running then, he talked about securing the border and deporting undocumented immigrants who had committed crimes, but this time, he's talking about deporting *all* of them in massive waves that could be very disruptive. His proposed tariff regime is also much more broad than anything he proposed in his first administration.

These are just a few things that make this time potentially different, but in truth, we don't quite know how he's going to govern, because he has a history of saying he's going to do stuff that he never does.",10,2024-11-12 18:50:16,2024-11-13 00:08:29,0.6

Thanks in advance.",55,42,13,"A lot of it has to do with the margins. In 2016, yes the Dems lost, but they lost in a rather fluky way. Trump got JUST enough votes to swing key states by the slimmest of margins, and even that only happened because of Comey's fluky investigation into Clinton a week before the election. But this election, Harris lost by a rather convincing margin in literally every swing state. This wasn't a close race that was narrowly lost with an unclear public mandate. This was a direct and clear and notable rejection of the incumbents.

Also, it should be noted that Biden had an objectively VERY good presidency. He accomplished more meaningful legislation than anyone since...LBJ? That's huge. Yes, inflation sucked, but that was also a global phenomenon that swept across every major political system and the US handled that MUCH better than anyone else, plus a lot of that had to directly with actions taken by the administration. Biden will be a president who gets much love from the history books, and so for a lot of Dems they're caught in the despair of ""if we couldn't win with THAT kind of track record, then what even is the point of anything at all?""

Finally, there's a perception that Trump should be a much weaker candidate now than in 2016. In 2016 he was at least somewhat of an unknown quantity and hadn't really governed poorly yet. In 2024, Trump is a convicted felon, a traitor who sold state secrets, someone who incited an insurrection, mishandled the pandemic, had very few if any policy victories, etc. That Trump was so bad and Biden was so good is just adding to the Dem despair right now.

One last note is that I do think there's a bit of overreaction and recency bias going on. There were MANY folks in 2016 who thought this was the end of US democracy and that Trump getting elected was one of the worst things to ever happen to this country. We had a tremendous amount of ""not my president"" and a lot less resignation than we're seeing this time around. (Just to be clear, resignation is not a bad thing--Dems should be still committed to election results even if they are atrocious.) Also, as you pointed out, despite Harris's very poor performance, the Congressional races were much better and Trump will likely have a hard time implementing the more incendiary parts of his agenda without sweeping coattails.",12,2024-11-12 18:50:16,2024-11-12 21:22:58,0.65

Some quotes:

**American voters are less ideologically polarized than they think they are, and that misperception is greatest for the most politically engaged people**. 

However, most partisans hold major misbeliefs about the other party’s preferences that lead them to think there is far less shared policy belief. This perception gap is highest among progressive activists, followed closely by extreme conservatives: in other words, the people who are most involved in civic and political life hold the least accurate views of the other side’s beliefs. Figure 1 shows the gap between what groups of Americans think the other side believes and what they self-report believing, as of 2019.

**American politicians are highly ideologically polarized. In other words, they believe in and vote for different sets of policies, with little overlap. This trend has grown in a steady, unpunctuated manner for decades.** 

One reason that the most highly politically engaged Americans may misunderstand the other side is that they correctly estimate the extreme ideological polarization among politicians. 

While at this point, candidates and parties may be responding to polarized primary voters, candidates and parties have been driving the polarization, and not all voters are ideologically polarized. 

The disparity between where leaders are ideologically and where their voters are precludes legislative policy agreement on many issues. Average voters are not able to assert their (often weak) policy preferences because they do not have an effective way to vote out representatives who do not accurately represent their constituents’ views, particularly on the right where party chairs are likely to substitute one extreme candidate for another.

**Even though Americans are not as ideologically polarized as they believe themselves to be, they** ***are*** **emotionally polarized (known as “affective polarization”). In other words, they do not like members of the other party.** 

Americans harbor strong dislike for members of the other party (though they also dislike their own parties, as well). While social media is often blamed for this phenomenon, affective polarization started growing before the internet: its onset more closely correlates with the rise of cable news and radio talk shows.

**Similarly, affective polarization is not causing political violence directly. It is probably contributing to an environment that allows politicians and opinion leaders to increase violence targeted at politicians, election officials, women, and many types of minorities.** 

Affective polarization in the United States has been rising for decades, while political violence only increased sharply in 2016. Affective polarization is also quite symmetrical across parties, while political violence is overwhelmingly from the right. This suggests that emotional feelings of hatred toward members of the other party are not a primary cause of political violence. ",15,2025-01-05 06:03:44,2025-01-05 22:47:14,0

He appointed the conservative judges who made the Supreme Court decision that has overturned Roe. 

>I don't get to the extent of what she will be able to do

A president has limited power in this respect. She can appoint progressive justices when seats open up, which could eventually (like a decade or two) reinstate Roe if control of the court flips. If she is willing to take steps Biden would not, she could expand the court or bypass the filibuster to allow congress to legislate a federal abortion protection. She has made one vague comment suggesting she might be willing to do something like this where Biden was unwilling. 

>In short, what will happen if either of these people get elected in terms of abortion?

In short, almost definitely nothing. If either president tries to immediately push for a federal law for or against abortion, they will be blocked by the filibuster in the senate. Republicans are unlikely to change filibuster rules because they face increasingly steep odds of keeping chamber control so the filibuster helps them more than it hurts them. Democrats under Harris might be willing to change rules, but Harris has a decent chance of coming into office without senate control this cycle, so it would take at least two years for democrats to gain control in midterm elections before they could push their agenda. 

In long? Republicans means less access to abortion and Democrats means more access. How this plays out can vary, as I've explained, but those are the clearly stated aims of the party platforms and no matter what other tactics are tried, court control is always an issue and will always play out the same way. Democrat control means judges more likely to support abortion access and Republican control means more likely to restrict it.",40,2024-11-01 00:44:40,2024-11-01 13:40:31,0.0

Thank you for responding in advance ",49,43,6,"*Roe v. Wade* was a 50 year-old Supreme Court decision that, along with some subsequent decisions, gave women nationwide the right to terminate their pregancies up until the point of fetal viability, which means until the fetus could conceivably survive outside the womb. That translated to around 24 weeks.

In 2016, when Trump was campaigning for President, he promised he would nominate Supreme Court justices who would overturn *Roe v. Wade.* Publicly stating a legal litmus test for Supreme Court justices was highly unorthodox and frowned upon, because those judges are ostensibly just supposed to interpret the law, not come in with preconceived notions. But Trump did make that promise, and once elected, he fulfilled it. 

As a result, anti-abortion groups made various attempts to get a case before the newly shifted court and they were eventually successful in getting *Roe v. Wade* overturned with the ""Dobbs"" decision, thereby leaving the terms of abortion rights to individual state governments, some of which have severely restricted those rights, or may in the future. Others have reaffirmed the rights. 

So, presently, whether or not a woman has a right to an abortion, and the degree to which said right is restricted, depends entirely on which state she lives in, not what her doctor recommends.

Trump immediately took credit for overturning the national right to abortion and has continued to do so in the present campaign. He says leaving the determination to individual states' governments was the right one.

Kamala Harris, if elected, is unlikely to have an opportunity to appoint different justices in the next four years, because the conservatives currently on the bench are unlikely to vacate their seats during her presidency. What she has said, instead, is that if the Congress passes a bill to restore the protections under *Roe v. Wade* — a nationwide right to abortion up to the point of fetal viability — she would sign it into law. The chances of Congress passing such a bill are not high, however, because the legislature is pretty evenly split right now. It's likely Harris would take other measures to protect abortion rights where she can, though, such as in the military and by providing support for women who need to travel to other states to get such care.",7,2024-11-01 00:44:40,2024-11-01 23:13:17,0.6

Thank you for responding in advance ",49,43,6,"Don't be fooled Roe V Wade was always a temporary measure. Was never a law and it was always going to be overturned if it ever went to the Supreme Court. Let me explain:

We are not a Democracy,  are a Constitutional Republic, what does that mean?
It means that we can make laws and vote for or against anything as long as it doesn't violate the Constitution. Our founding fathers wanted it this way after having experienced tyranny at the hands of the British Monarchy.

Abortion has never been a constitutionally protected right. I am not saying abortion is good nor bad, I'll stay out of that debate only saying that its not constitutionally protected.

Since the Supreme Court can only rule on weather something is Constitutional or not they had to overturn it. 

If you think Abortion should be protected by the constitution that an amendment needs to be added to the Constitution, and there are ways to do it. 

If not then it goes back to the individual states (in this case) to allow or not allow abortion.

This also means that Trump cannot outlaw abortion if he wins, nor can Veep Harris overturn the Supreme Court rulling. 

Both politicians are lying about what they are going to do about Abortion, but thats what politicians do.",1,2024-11-01 00:44:40,2024-11-04 18:05:38,-0.30

Thank you for responding in advance ",49,43,6,"Roe V Wade was overturned by the supreme court since it was unconstitutional. Now, states can decide how to progress on legality of abortion. If you're in California, you can still twerk-abort babies on stage, but now if you're in Texas, you can be hunted down and arrested for having an abortion.

Basically, it is a state decision on how to rule on it, which I think is very fair considering there are such populations groups for and against abortion. They should make it so states like Texas can't arrest Californians for having abortions in California, but by that logic, Texans should not be allowed to get abortions in California unless they move.

Ultimately this all works if the federal government restricts any state for imposing their laws on those of another state. Without that, this is highly unconstitutional. (i won't get into the morality of abortion, however, as that depends on the person).",1,2024-11-01 00:44:40,2024-11-05 03:15:23,0.15

Thank you for responding in advance ",49,43,6,"I feel like the modern day pharisees have brainwashed America. On lots of things but it shows the most with abortion right now. Where in the bible does it say life starts at conception?? It doesn't. It says life starts in the womb which... duh. Historically people believed this occurred with quickening or baby kicks. Or now we also know that babies brains aren't developed until month 5 when they are able to experience feelings and start to become viable. Whereas the ""heartbeat"" fallacy is a lie because there is NO HEART at week 6. 

Why do conservatives care? Voters care because they THINK they're being Christian. Im Christian and I follow my heart and my faith and I think this hides a big lie. The real reason the GOP cares is because 1) the birth rate is shrinking and the alternative to population growth is immigration which isn't desirable among white supremacists and 2) the traditional values mascarades the belief that women belong barefoot in the kitchen serving their husband's. The latter is also why GOP aims to decimate public education. And ironically taking women out of the workforce HURTS THE ECONOMY. But theres lots of contradictions here including the fact that:

Christ said love thy neighbor as thyself. Not ""unless you're straight"" and not ""America first"" and not ""only after you've made a homemade arsenal.""

1. The super PAC point is moot in presidential elections.  Trump has been very outspent in every election he’s been in, and it doesn’t seem to make much difference.  Corporate-interest donors are a thing, but they’re not nearly as relevant as you think.  There’s a *ton* of billionaire donors who clearly aren’t in it for profit, and if anything just happen to be ideologues who have a ton of money.  And there’s plenty of billionaires who fund progressives (Steyer, Bloomberg, Soros).  There’s also very limited evidence that Super PAC money is relevant.  The campaigns that rely on Super PAC’s instead of their own campaigns (where donations are capped) tend to do very poorly.  There’s just so much small-dollar money in politics right now on both the left and right that getting a giant influx of Super PAC money isn’t actually a big difference-maker.

2. You’re obviously correct that Democrats have lost non-college working class people, but I think your analysis is off.  From a *policy* perspective, the Democratic Party’s leadership is more progressive than ever.  Obama governed to Clinton’s left economically.  Hillary Clinton ran on an economic agenda to Obama’s left.  Biden governed in a much more progressive way than Obama, and moreso than Hillary proposed. Biden catered to unions in ways no Democrat had done, pushed climate-related spending no Democrat had ever proposed.  The Build Back Better bill went way further than anything that any other Democratic president would have done.  But it was Bill Clinton who put up the best numbers with working class voters, by a mile. He was more *moderate* than the previous two Democratic nominees (Dukakis and Mondale), but did way better among non-college voters.  Today, non-college voters disassociate from Democrats not because of their policy proposals, but because of a feeling that the party is not interested in them *despite* those policies.  Democrats are the party of progressive activist groups, who are quite out of touch with actual working class people.  Their rhetoric is alienating.  The vibes are all wrong.  Their priorities seem pointless.   Proposing yet another massive transfer of wealth, or a bigger welfare state, does not solve this.  Democrats need to stand up to the unpopular elements of their own coalition.",7,2024-11-12 21:54:34,2024-11-14 02:03:04,0.5

Just wondering what caused the masses to believe it was a good idea, and just why everyone cared worldwide",35,32,3,"TL;DR: Many voters did not fully grasp what Brexit would mean in practice. Many Leave voters were surprised that Vote Leave actually won. In the end Brexit turned out to include many trade-offs that had not been put on the foreground, which made the process way more difficult and lengthier than expected by ordinary voters.

The outcome of the 2016 Brexit referendum was close: 51.9% voted Leave and 48.1% voted Remain ([BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/eu_referendum/results)). The most important concerns for Leave voters were sovereignty and immigration, whereas the most important concern for Remain voters was the economy ([UK in a Changing Europe](https://ukandeu.ac.uk/other-publication/peoples-stated-reasons-for-voting-leave-or-remain/)). 

Leave voters felt that too many laws were made in Brussels by the (unelected bureaucrats of the) EU, with not enough say over these laws by the UK. These concerns were strongly pushed by the British tabloid press ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/06/21/482952581/bendy-bananas-and-barmaid-bosoms-the-u-k-s-crazy-anti-eu-food-myths)), but saying that an unpopular policy was demanded by Brussels/the EU was often a convenient way for British ministers to avoid having to take responsibility for agreeing to these policies in the first place or even adding extra rules on top (a practice known as gold-plating). The Vote Leave campaign aptly summed up the desire for more sovereignty with the slogan 'Take Back Control'. They also pointed towards the high contribution of the UK to the EU budget and suggested that these funds could be better spent at home, for example on the National Health Service. They put this on a red bus and drove it all around the country ([BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42698981)). 

In 2004 ten countries in Central and Eastern Europe became new members of the EU. That meant that their citizens got the right to work in other EU Member States, including the UK. As a result, a large number of these citizens moved to the UK for work. This fueled the idea in the UK that there were just too many East Europeans in the country  and that this led to wage suppression and by voting for Brexit these immigrants would leave again. In addition, in 2015 there was a large uncontrolled influx of people from the Middle East and Africa into the EU. Many Brits were concerned with possibly large numbers of asylum seekers arriving in Britain, which was also fueled by the British tabloid press ([UK in a Changing Europe](https://ukandeu.ac.uk/tabloid-tales-how-the-tabloid-press-shaped-the-brexit-vote/)). A related concern was that Turkey was a candidate country for membership of the EU and this might in the future also lead to a large number of Turkish migrants moving to the UK.",5,2024-11-13 16:54:50,2024-11-13 23:52:05,0

1) Black populations in the state, this is ironically a legacy of slavery, Virginia was a slave state a lot of black slaves were brought to Virginia, this lead to relatively large black populations in the state around 18%, meanwhile West Virginia has only 3% black population, black people vote predominantly Democrat.

(demographics taken from world population review) 

2) Urbanisation levels, this might be the largest one, West Virginia has effectively only one relatively large town and that is Charleston-Huntington metro area. And even that is relatively small, this leads to rest of the populace being in small towns or rural areas. Meanwhile Virginia has of course NoVa (Northern Virginia is the most talked about) with cities like Arlington and Alexandria. But let's not forget about Norfolk metro area, with cities like Virginia Beach and Newport News. And then the capital Richmond itself. Virginia has quite large metro areas. Summarised Virginia has 77,6% urbanisation rate, meanwhile West Virginia has 44,6% urbanisation rate.

(urban rate brought from Wikipedia)

3) Education and end of Coal mining industry in West Virginia, West Virginia was historically a coal mining state, you don't need particularly educated workforce for that. And since the Democrats controlled the state since the coal industry collapsed there was a massive swing to the Republicans, West Virginia feels betrayed by Democrats, only around 13% of West Virginians have a college degree. Meanwhile Virginia has NoVa, NoVa is important state wide for being a service economy hub and important for federal administration, you need high education for these jobs, that's why Virginia has almost twice as large College degree graduation lying at around 25%. This again moves it to vote more Democratic.

(information from Statista)

The [Fourteenth Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/amendment-14/section-1/) protects the right to move from one state to another. There is some amount of research into this topic, some suggesting that overall trends lead to outflow of wealthy citizens with increased income taxes. [Shocker: Wealthy Americans tend to flee high-income tax states](https://www.investmentnews.com/tax/shocker-wealthy-americans-tend-to-flee-high-income-tax-states/251879) (citing [The Introduction of the Income Tax, Fiscal Capacity, and Migration: Evidence from US States](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20210388)). Other studies have concluded that this is actually a minority factor in citizen movement, focusing on employment opportunities as a more powerful driver. [State Taxes Have a Minimal Impact on People’s Interstate Moves](https://www.cbpp.org/research/state-budget-and-tax/state-taxes-have-a-minimal-impact-on-peoples-interstate-moves). 

A wealth tax is new territory though, because we're talking about taxing people based on assets as opposed to income, Elizabeth Warren's proposal for example proposes an increased tax only on households with more than 50 million in assets, approximately the wealthiest 75,000 households. [Ultra-Millionaire Tax](https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/ultra-millionaire-tax). You didn't ask about the efficacy of these taxes and/or implementation, so I'm not going to touch on the nuance of the plans; that plan is a good example though, tax the absolute wealth-hoarders and leave everyone else untouched. 

If the Federal Government implemented such a plan, it's likely that the math would work out (depending on the proposal) that for *some* percentage of the ultra-wealthy population, it would make more sense to simply leave the country and not pay. Some are dual citizens and could renounce, others could renounce their citizenship and seek residency in one of the nations that allows investment residency/citizenship. Would anyone actually do that? we don't know, it depends on the individuals and the specific plan. It's tough to extricate yourself from a country, and it's tough to extricate yourself from the U.S. economy. These are the people who have the easiest time (financially) abandoning the country, but simultaneously some of the largest headaches (financially) when doing so. 

If a State Government implemented such a plan, the math of moving would probably be more appetizing for a LOT more people. There is no application process for moving a domicile. There is no need to shield assets, if you live somewhere else, the tax just doesn't apply. There is no need to stop doing business in the U.S.,  liquidate assets, or stop vacationing in your home state.  It would be appetizing to simply buy a home in another state, pretend to live there, and fraudulently establish the domicile. Obviously, I'm not condoning that behavior, and it wouldn't be legal, but it's practical. It's a lot easier to claim you live in Mississippi than to claim you live in Spain. 

You'll notice the last two paragraphs don't have citations, and that's because this is highly theoretical. We know the effect increased taxes have on movement between states. It's at least *a* factor, even if you don't agree it's *the* factor; in either case, the correlation is there. A wealth tax on the ultra-wealthiest by a state may or may not make citizens flee, but the calculation to do so would be far in their favor when compared to a federal tax.

It seems unlikely (to me) that this will happen because internal mobility in the U.S. can't be restricted.

Bill Gates and Larry Ellison have property in Florida and in order to be Florida residents for tax purposes they'd just have to spend more time there, which I'm guessing is not a huge hardship.

You wouldn't even need to do that.  Establishing residence in another state is, frankly, easy.  Get a new place, change mailing address, get a new DL, open new bank accounts in that new state.  That can be done in a matter of a week.  The old residence can either be sold or rented out.

Not so much daily tracking, but I’ve found the following two Australian resources incredibly helpful.    
In-depth analysis and background on a topic, cutting out all of the ‘crazy’ [no offence intended]  

I found both incredibly valuable, since the Australian public broadcaster has no as and is taxpayer funded:    Means they don’t need hyperbole and aren’t beholden to corporate interests.   
The whole prob of attracting or ticking off advertisers doesn’t arise.   

Both are a lot more down to earth than most free U.S. outlets:   I’ve found YouTube vids to have super-hyperbolic titles ….. and then I wasted like half an hour watching something that was fairly uninformed I’ve and underwhelming. 😢

Ask_Politics,top,Why are US conservatives so open to pulling support from Ukraine but not Israel?,What gives? They're choosing the side that's been accused of genocide in both conflicts. ,24,19,5,"The two conflicts are thought of quite differently, speaking as a former conservative myself. We can stitch together a good answer from the evidence from Trump's first term, and how the modern conservative movement talks about the conflict.

 

Short Summary: **\*\*Conservatives are against funding Ukraine because of Trump's personal animosity against the country, top donor and adviser's empathy for Russia's position, and apathy about the stakes of the war either in Ukraine or Israel.\*\***

 

I'll break down the evidence from here to make the argument:

Part One:  

**\[\*\*1. Remember that Trump was first impeached in 2019 due to his attempt to blackmail Ukraine into announcing a public investigation into his political rival by withholding military aid and support.\*\*\]**([https://www.vox.com/c/2020/2/6/20914280/impeachment-trump-explained](https://www.vox.com/c/2020/2/6/20914280/impeachment-trump-explained))

 

The source above explains the details but the origin of the impeachment was because of a call Trump placed to the President of Ukraine directly asking him to investigate President Joe Biden's son so that he had something to smear him with ahead of the US presidential election in November. A whistleblower identified the call logs had been scrubbed, and identified Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani in concert with sympathetic businessmen in Ukraine and Russia were sent to negotiate further with Ukraine.

 

The specific ask, captured on the call logs between Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, was for Ukraine to ""do a favor"" and open an investigation into CrowdStrike (a cybersecurity company that was the subject of an election-related conspiracy theory Trump appeared to believe in) and to discuss with Rudy Giuliani an investigation into Hunter Biden.

 

Ukraine did not do this, although Zelenskyy's aide apparently entertained a chat with Giuliani. Because Ukraine did not follow through, Trump's administration did indeed withhold military aid mentioned on the phonecall that had already been approved for export. This led to a public investigation - of Trump - in the US by Congress, and ultimately to his impeachment. Trump has had a personal animosity against Ukraine ever since, according to lev Parnas, who was one of his original envoys in the blackmail effort alongside Rudy Giuliani: \[Why Donald Trump ‘hates Ukraine’ – POLITICO\]([https://www.politico.eu/article/why-donald-trump-hates-ukraine-us-congress-kyiv-war/](https://www.politico.eu/article/why-donald-trump-hates-ukraine-us-congress-kyiv-war/))

  \[Even further back, there was relatively little pushback from the Republican Party when Trump's top advisers asked to remove ""support for Ukraine"" from the official party platform in 2016.\]([https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mueller-asked-trump-2016-rnc-platform-change-ukraine/story?id=59476035](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mueller-asked-trump-2016-rnc-platform-change-ukraine/story?id=59476035))",1,2024-11-19 22:41:07,2024-11-28 15:33:21,0.65
Ask_Politics,top,Why are US conservatives so open to pulling support from Ukraine but not Israel?,What gives? They're choosing the side that's been accused of genocide in both conflicts. ,24,19,5,"The short and sweet of it - [Israel is an ally ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93United_States_relations)and Ukraine is not.  That's a big influence.

From here, things get a bit complicated and reams of digital ink could be burned in writing every possible way, but I'm going to focus on one point that I think is the ultimate reason: **Israel can win its war at our current level of support, Ukraine cannot.**

Unless we start giving much more lethal aid or directly intervene ourselves, there simply is no route for Ukraine to reclaim their lost territories.  While they were able to repel the initial attacks (especially in the north near Kyiv), you can find [time lapses showing the lines/territory](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/733fe90805894bfc8562d90b106aa895) and see that its basically settled into a front line in the east and along Dnipro River in the south - which is to be expected as rivers make for good fortification.  But in this case its also a problem for Ukraine, too, as they have to cross that river as well.

If we (or any European nation) is not willing to intervene and fight to help Ukraine retake those territories, then, in my view, it is almost immoral to continue to support Ukraine in what is a meatgrinder with one or two results - Ukraine eventually loses as Russia grinds on or we reach a stalemate where Russia itself finds its gains acceptable and stops pushing.  If we have to choose between a stalemate and a loss, I'll take the stalemate and believe we should push Ukraine to formalize it in a peace treaty.  Is it ideal?  Absolutely not.  I'd rather Ukraine kick in Russia's teeth... but they don't seem to have that capacity and at some point demographics start coming into play.  Does Ukraine want to sacrifice a [generation of young men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War#Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine)?

Compare that to Israel.  Hamas is all but defeated and the only reason it isn't... is due to the US constantly wanting Israel to be careful.  Its been so successful that its decided to open a second front and attack another group that has attacked it over the years in Lebanon and achieved the same result - Hezbollah has been critically degraded and [Lebanon is not in control of much of its south](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-price-lebanon-is-paying-for-the-hezbollah-israel-war), and Israel can strike anywhere in the country seemingly at will.  Even Iran, who twice has [fired at Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/02/west-defend-israel-iranian-attack), did basically no damage while[ Israel struck back into Iran with almost no issue](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr0yvrx4qpo).

  
Now, all this said, I think the US policy *is correct* in that we do not want either war to become something bigger - we do not want Russia to use nukes and we do not want Israel and Iran to go to war with each other.  With all of that above and those goals in place, what is the most likely want to achieve that?  Ultimately, it means pushing Ukraine to be realistic and pressing Israel to use restraint as necessary.  And I think we can achieve both under either Biden or Trump.",-3,2024-11-19 22:41:07,2024-11-21 20:00:19,-0.50

Russia has made a concerted - and successful - effort to influence top advisers within Trump's inner circle and the upper echelons of the Republican Party.\*\***

 

Little remembered now is the case of Maria Butina, a Russian intelligence officer that went undercover within the Republican Party to influence it from the inside, largely through growing connections to key Republican fundraisers and affiliated organizations like\[ Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne\]([https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/maria-butina-russia-spy-fbi-860256/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/maria-butina-russia-spy-fbi-860256/)) (a top Trump donor) and the \[National Rifle Association\]([https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44885633](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44885633)). This is but one example of a larger problem: There appears to have been a concerted effort by the Russian intelligence apparatus to at least seed the Republican Party with pro-Russia views, and that inevitably paid off later with a variety of people within Trump's inner circle echoing Russia's propaganda on its invasion of Ukraine and overtly supporting the Russian war effort.

 

Nowhere is this more obvious than in Elon Musk and David Sacks, two of Trump's most important donors for his 2024 campaign and two of his top advisers informing his transition and administration. \[Elon Musk was personally called upon by President Putin of Russia early in the war after Ukraine was found to be using Starlink communications equipment for its war effort.\]([https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/10/28/fiona-hill-explains-trump-musk-putin-00185820](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/10/28/fiona-hill-explains-trump-musk-putin-00185820)) He \[subsequently disabled Starlink connectivity for the Ukrainian military at critical points in the war\]([https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66752264](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66752264)), influenced by Putin's view that Ukraine could not catastrophically win against the Russian occupation.

 

To put another bow on it, Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's nominee for Director of National Intelligence, \[has been paid and feted by Russia's state-owned media circuit as far back as 2015.\]([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-trump-russia.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-trump-russia.html)) It is not clear these people want Ukraine to win the war - quite the opposite. They prefer Russia ultimately prevail.

 

To be clear, these people are not Russian intelligence sources or agents themselves. They likely genuinely believe what they say about Russia's position on the war for a variety of reasons -  For other folks in Trump's orbit like Gabbard, there is a mixture of plain antiwar feeling that favors Russia winning over any extended US role, as well as a sense of obligation after being so prominently boosted by Russia's state media and propaganda networks.",1,2024-11-19 22:41:07,2024-11-28 15:33:28,0.8

You just need to understand your stance on the issues you care about and be able to talk about that stance competently. It's okay to not have a stance on issues that are important to other people. It's also okay to change your stance when exposed to new information.

The idea that you need to categorize yourself into a certain ideological bucket is a propaganda method meant to get you to identify with the more palatable aspects of an ideology so you are more likely to agree with the less palatable aspects of that ideology. It also gets you emotionally invested in defending aspects of that ideology when presented with contradictory evidence.

When political scientists categorize people into ideology groups, it's a method of describing behavior. When people start identifying with those descriptors, it becomes a method of prescribing behavior and enforcing it on other people.

You don't need to play that game. You can be a perfectly well informed politically invested individual and not identify with any ideology. Eventually, you might accept an identity as a description of your beliefs, but you don't need to tie yourself to that identity. If you are pro-widget and are called a widgetist, it's okay to call youself a widgetist. It's also okay to stop calling yourself a widgetist when other people who call themselves widgetists start believing in something you don't believe in.

Whatever you do, don't go chasing political compass or its derivatives. They're designed specifically to get you to identify with weird idiosyncratic identities so you feel ostracized from the mainstream. If you want to read a dense philosophical work on the subject of identity and politics, I highly recommend [Hannah Arendt's *The Human Condition*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Human_Condition_(Arendt_book\)).",49,2024-12-30 05:27:46,2024-12-30 17:49:02,0

A good place to start, though, would be a textbook.[ This is the textboo](https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393542240)k I used in college, which has a ten-page section on Political Ideologies that gives a very basic overview.

A little more advanced is the book [Ideology: A short introduction](https://academic.oup.com/book/768), chapters 6 and 7 will give you a more extended but still simplified overview.

Even though each political label has a culture surrounding it, the fact is that these ideologies are more like a constellation of common viewpoints than something monolithic. There's a lot of variation in there. It's like a bunch of different variables united by a generally similar set of values and not so much a uniform thing.

If you want to dig in a little bit on what the major political parties in the US believe, I'd recommend a data-driven approach. As in, take a look at some polls about where voters in each party stand. This will give you a cleaner idea of what people believe, without the heavy editorialization you can often find in places like YouTube. Of course, feel free to read/watch/listen to as much editorialization as you want but sometimes it's hard to sort out the facts from partisan rhetoric.

Politics is a means to promoting specific outcomes, exercising and maintaining power. If you want to develop your sense of politics, develop your sense of morality. You can always evaluate a political outcome on the basis of your own internal moral compass.

To understand why we need society, government and politics you can look at what happens when power structures are left unchecked. 

If you want to understand how people survive political oppression you could read Viktor Frankl - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man%27s\_Search\_for\_Meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man%27s_Search_for_Meaning) he was a psychotherapist imprisoned in concentration camps by the Nazis.

You can read up on the Trail of Tears or Pinochet's Chile. Take any example from the list of human atrocities we have committed on each other and you begin to see why we need to center uplifting humanity in all facets of life. Go from there.

To answer the OP's question--turnout definitely wasn't *low* this year. A lot of people across social media claimed it was after election night (talking about ""twenty million missing votes"" or whatever), without understanding that many states can take a while to count, and that California (which accounts for millions of Democratic votes) and big cities (who also have a lot of mostly Democratic votes to count) often report final counts late.

Obviously anyone who says that he is ""in office"" right now, today, is mistaken, but he will be in office in just a bit over 2 months, so pretty soon.

Giving them the benefit of the doubt, they aren't referring to a particular law or policy, but that voters, knowing what was at stake, chose the candidate who would not protect abortion access over one who would.

The most likely changes regarding abortion policy under a Trump administration are going to be court-related. The Biden administration has been willing to sue states that it felt made abortion restrictions that were too restrictive (and Idaho's was partially overturned by SCOTUS because it conflicted with federal law). The Trump administration is unlikely to continue to challenge states' abortion restrictions in court.

Additionally, Trump will be able to appoint more federal judges, making it more likely for the courts to uphold strict abortion laws. One of Trump's previous appointees went so far as to issue a ruling that rescinded FDA approval for one of the main abortion medications, but he was overturned on appeal. A second Trump administration allows more like-minded judges to be appointed and possibly at to higher levels.

Additionally additionally, some localities are trying to enact laws that would punish people for even *traveling through* to obtain an abortion. A Trump administration might or might not challenge such laws, but a Harris administration certainly would have.",6,2024-11-07 02:57:35,2024-11-07 21:06:14,0.6

At this time, whether a woman has bodily autonomy after becoming pregnant depends entirely on where she lives and/or whether she has the resources to get somewhere else. In states with Trump abortion bans--whether Florida's now-permanent 6-week ban, or those states where the ban starts at a time when women CAN actually know they are pregnant--women lose bodily autonomy the moment they become pregnant. At that point, the state can regulate, control, and punish what she eats and drinks, where she goes, how she behaves, etc. There are women in jail today for ""endangering an unborn child"" for the decisions made before or after learning they were pregnant. 

The MAGA legislators have no intention of ""leaving it to the states,"" BTW, no matter what Trump says. There is a national ban coming--and even if there is no national ban, if you live in a state with a ban, it might as well be national. Moreover, even if a woman has no intention of ever having an abortion, in states like Texas now, the laws are such that if she comes to a point where she needs one to save her life and fertility, her doctor risks a 99-year prison sentence for performing a life-saving abortion that is later deemed by some law-enforcement agent as not having been necessary. 

And, to be clear, there is no situation in this country where a man who has not been at least accused of a crime can be stripped of his bodily autonomy. Nor do the partners of pregnant women have their rights revoked in any way whatsoever. 

That's why. Women no longer have a voice in what happens to them once they become pregnant, depending on what state they live in.",4,2024-11-07 02:57:35,2024-11-09 22:09:22,0.95

These Supreme Court justices said they would not get rid of Roe vs. Wade and then they did it anyway. Once that was done, Republican controlled states were able to enact strict abortion bans. For example, Texas bans abortions after 6 weeks. (Weeks of pregnancy start on the day of your last menstrual period, so at ""6 weeks"" it has only been 2 weeks since you missed your period. This gives you very little time to decide what to do next.)

Texas is supposed to allow exceptions for abortion if the mother's life is threatened, but it also says doctors will get life in prison for ""murder"" if they perform an abortion outside of these circumstances. No one has clearly defined what a life threatening condition during pregnancy really is, and doctors don't want to get life in prison, so they are waiting too long to perform life saving abortions. Now multiple women in Texas have died and lost fertility from care being delayed (even women who had wanted, planned pregnancies). The maternal mortality rate in Texas is up over 50% since these laws were enacted in 2021. In states without these laws, the maternal mortality rate is up 11%. 

I live in Texas and my husband and I are talking about moving because we want to have a baby in a few years. I would be scared of dying from a preventable death if I were pregnant in this state. It's sad because we have built our lives here and I really don't want to move, but it does make me nervous.

The United Nations considers abortion to be a human right. I hope you understand the importance of voting and do so in the future. You are already trying to educate yourself, so that is a good start.",1,2024-11-07 02:57:35,2024-11-10 16:07:53,0.85

Obviously we'll all be watching the seven swing states (GA, NC, PA, WI, MI, NV, AZ) but there are a few other states that have been in discussions of being play that could give a sign of how the race might turn out.  

The earliest of these is New Hampshire - if it turns red, it could be a long night for Harris.  Likewise, Ohio a half hour earlier has been discussed as well.  If Trump performs poorly here, it could be a long night for him as well.

And then there's Minnesota.  I won't believe it until a week from now, but its been discussed and I'd be remiss to not mention it.  Even though I don't believe it and I will donate to charity if I'm wrong.

Trump has been leading more than Moreno so it'll be a test of Trump's (rather lacking in the last two elections) coat tails.  And then there's Montana out there which could be interesting too.  But Pennsylvania too, which is just a sign that the election gods want us watching that state tonight.

**House Races**

There's a bunch and its all over the place.  But it'll be a good test on both sides.

We'll be around tonight hanging out and we look forward to talking with you!",2,2024-11-05 14:22:37,2024-11-05 14:28:08,0

Ask_Politics,top,Were any of the Pro-Trump or otherwise far-right Dank Memes on Vine astroturfed by groups like Cambridge Analytica?,"When I was about 20 or 21, Dank Meme Vine compilations were a huge phenomenon on YouTube, and many of said compilations seemed to have strong populist right messaging, often featuring overtly Pro-Trump/Anti-Hillary memes, anti-feminist memes, anti-LGBT memes/jokes about how many genders there are, etc. Granted, these were interspersed with bog-standard absurdist or edgy memes, but the editorial slant of these compilations was pretty clear.

Having heard all the recent discourse about this Jubilee debate between Medhi Hasan and young conservatives (at least one of whom reportedly accepted the label of ""fascist""), it occurs to me that a lot of the youths in that video are probably young enough to have seen these compilations when their political consciousness was just starting to develop and to have had their outlooks shaped by these memes on some subconscious level. More broadly, Gen Z is noticeably flipping right (as demonstrated during this past election cycle), and internet culture is playing an increasingly bigger role in youth politics, so I wonder if Dank Meme Vines were one of the initial catalysts for this shift, and if so, whether lobbyist/special interest/data mining groups were involved.

As cursory as my understanding of cyber warfare is, I do know that Cambridge Analytica used Facebook surveys to build psychological profiles of users, disseminate targeted Pro-Trump memes to these users, and covertly influence their voting decisions/political opinions. With that in mind, could a group like Cambridge Analytica or even a foreign political body like the Kremlin have produced Pro-Trump/populist right Dank Memes as a form of astroturfing and subsequently paid compilation producers to curate Dank Meme compilations in a way that favored far-right interests? Given how people like Peter Thiel are now essentially psyopping Zoomers into ""trad"" ideology with faux-grassroots ""new media"" or how Tim Pool (a self-proclaimed ""independent journalist"") was revealed to have taken funding from RT, it wouldn't surprise me if some Machiavellian organization had also used Vine/Dank Memes as a covert influence on youth politics circa 2016.",12,11,1,"Welcome to /r/ask_politics.

Democrats took the mantle of ""populism.""

The Democrats also developed close ties to""white ethnics,"" Jewish, Irish, Italian, and, to a lesser extent, Germans. This coalition,  white ethnics,  some portion of the working class, and anyone annoyed with whoever the Republican president was quickly became a majority in NYC

People also voted for more based on the relationships they had with local politicians and the Tammany Hall Society, which ran NYC politics for about a hundred years from around the 1860s to the 1940s and was close with the Democratic party

Trump has made clear through statements and past actions that tariffs will only be used as leverage - not economic doctrine. He intends to implement a 10% tariff on China unless they give him assurances that fentanyl manufacturers and smugglers will be dealt with harshly (as in he has asked for death penalty).

It seems kind of convenient conservatives are jumping on [this latest talking point from Trump](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg7y52n411o) as a kind of off-ramp for his tariff rhetoric. Previously he's made explicitly [economic justifications](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/tariffs-tax-cuts-core-trumps-economic-pitch-voters-2024-09-24/) for his incredibly broad tariff plans. Its good for the US that even conservatives are starting to acknowledge how disastrous his earlier tariff proposals were but its not as if he's giving us reason to believe he'll be consistent. 

>A 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico will be imposed if they do not agree to his demands regarding illegal immigration and drugs. Both of these countries will most likely oblige because they do not want a 25% tariff.

We (and I mean the US public, Mexico, China and likely Trump himself) don't even know what those demands look like in reality. Its an amorphous target that could easily be used as a justification for Trump to impose tariffs whenever he wants to. 

>What is key to remember is that tariffs are not his economic doctrine - they are a power tool and leverage. In the first trump administration, he used similar methods with no inflationary pressure from tariffs.

>Remember he actually does not want tariffs - he is the one who threw NAFTA and came up with USMCA. That's a good representation of what it actually is.

Again, I sure hope you're right. Relying on the idea that a notoriously capricious man was just lying about his central (only?) economic strategy doesn't really inspire much confidence. 

>Trump's nominee for Treasury Sec Scott Bessent has said the President-elect does not intend to implement these tariffs if demands are met

* Can the president create tariffs? 

Yes, but you're not alone in being confused. The Constitution gives taxation powers to Congress in Article I, Section 8, ""Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises."" However, as you can see from [this wikipedia article on Trump's tariffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_tariffs#Legality), Congress passed two laws in the 70s saying that the president can create tariffs. Some of that appears to be in dispute but not enormously so. 

* What are the limits of executive orders? 

Consider that the president's job is to execute the laws that Congress has passed. Congress has passed laws that give the president the ability to create tariffs, the president can then execute Congress's will by creating whatever tariffs they see fit. 

The broader issue is that Congress has ceded more and more of its legislative authority to the president over the preceding decades. The reason why is complicated and beyond what can be adequately explained by me, but it can be summed up with partisan gridlock and a slow to react legislature.",13,2024-11-27 20:21:08,2024-11-28 03:17:30,0.0

In October, [a plurality of polled voters (42%)](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25252151/cnn-poll-on-2024-presidential-race.pdf) stated they had no strong opinions one way or the other on trans issues. That was after the Republican campaign placed about $100 million dollars down on vehemently anti-trans ads.

In November - after the election - voter attitudes switched to [a plurality (43%)](https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2024/11/21/dddbb/3), but only when the answer mentioned ""upholding traditional definitions of gender."" The particular problem there is I don't really like how that answer is worded - transgender people are not some kind of special third gender. They just identify as male or female. Nonetheless I think most people who answer 'yes' to that would be nominally anti-trans in some way.

Pretty much all the polling illustrating anti-trans attitudes among Independent voters comes after the election already occurred - so a early-to-late November timeframe. Prior to that, support splits relatively neatly along party lines. 

I think what people are struggling with here is *ex post facto justification* for voting for Trump. A lot of Independents were clearly intending to vote for Trump the entire time, but need to vocalize some kind of justification that makes them come off as more persuadable than they actually are. I've witnessed this in-person quite a lot since the campaign kicked off - many people wanted Trump for a variety of reasons, but don't want to articulate exactly why that is, so they make up a plausible reason that they suddenly 'switched.' The reality is that research shows time and time again - American voters are not persuaded by ads. They don't watch them and don't make up their minds based on single ads. [It entirely depends on the frequency of their exposure to many, many ads, and their larger information system.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01487-4) More so than that one ad, the anti-trans *campaign* run by the Republican party and their enthusiastic backers running important digital platforms such as Elon Musk affected voters over time and boosted turnout enough to get the barest points necessary for a win. 

I'll say I've never actually met someone that solely voted for something based on anti-trans rights. They're almost always hiding other beliefs that they just aren't comfortable vocalizing to someone they don't think will reciprocate.

Hope that provides some clarity. Can't answer on how other ads compare; would say in 2016 we saw a very similar information environment in regard to Trump voters and digital advertising.",1,2024-11-27 09:08:08,2024-11-28 15:23:40,0.6

Yeah, I think the problem is with the advent of social media, any individual ad is not going to have sway and attention like it would in the past. Ads premiered primetime and many people saw them as there were only a few locations where people got their news and were a captive audience. That's not true anymore, so I generally think we're beyond one specific ad having any significant influence on an election.",2,2024-11-27 09:08:08,2024-11-28 16:12:17,0
Ask_Politics,top,Where does the “Kamala is for They/Them” advertisement rank in terms of the most successful political advertisements in (recent) American history?,"I’m not sure how one can quantify an advertisements success, but I don’t remember ever hearing about how effective a specific ad was from sources on both sides. According to NYTimes the Harris campaign saw a 2.7% point switch to Trump due to the ad and none of the ads tested as a direct response to the ad did much.

Most who might care about the T issue were likely decided voters.

However, if the ad was effective , It was effective because it highlighted and reminded people that in first few years of their reign, the Biden Harris team steam rolled ahead on matters/ topics that most citizens don’t understand ( TQIAplus, DEI) in law and policies and has in fact made their lives more difficult while also prioritizing non-US Americans and other identity politics issues over issues and real world struggles (like the economy, safety, free speech) that many were concerned with. The Dems also say they did great with economy. Well, Then they did a horrible job communicating that which is another thing the ad did well. 

Dems being horrible at communicating their priorities and successes is also what the ad did well. It highlighted Harris’ crap communication in interviews and town halls. Is trans surgeries for felons a priority to the Dems? If not then why is this one of clearest stance quotes gotten from Harris during the whole campaign (that interview itself was not during the campaign but that is also part of the point) while Harris was too vague on solid action and policies and in all her interview history? 

And a although, Dem voters, Dem supporters, TQI plus activists will swear up and down all day long That trans is not an issue anyone cares about, the number one thing every day people noticed and heard from others behind close doors, in anonymous spaces, was  the fear of reprisal;  therefore silence,  around any concern or topic of TQI Plus and even other social justice issues like Israel Palestine. The fear of reprisal or ostracization,  therefore silence around this issue equals self -censorship (because of fear) and citizens taking a closer look at the encroachment on foundational us US American freedoms and closer at this issue no one can talk about freely (especially if they have a dissenting opinion).",1,2024-11-27 09:08:08,2024-12-07 17:00:33,-0.8

Things like [first past the post voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting), gerrymandering, voter obstruction laws, the [electoral college](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College), and institutional inertia favor an ""all or nothing"" partisan power structure.

As a voter, the only way you can ensure you get what you want is if you either vote all Democrat or all Republican, depending on your political leanings. And this is deliberate. This dynamic is by design and it ensures the two party duopoly remains intact.

Even the three branch structure of government itself favours the partisan duopoly. The way the US government is structured, POTUS is always the head of their partisan organization, in addition to being the head of state, the head of cabinet agencies, the head of foreign policy, and the head of the armed forces. That's a lot of incumbent authority to place in the hands of one of only two parties every election cycle. Also, any party with a simple majority in Congress wields incredible power over the minority party, since they can simply gridlock any proposed legislation at a procedural and committee level before it even reaches the assembly for consideration.

Even the judicial branch contributes to this, somewhat. Because SCOTUS is not beholden to the other two branches after a Justice is confirmed at the Senate level, anytime a party manages to stuff it with ideologically right or left justices, the court will be a partisan force in favour of one particular ideology or another potentially for decades, even if the popular will has shifted substantially.

Parties also make sure that people within their own ranks can't reasonably deviate from the party line, which further supresses diversity of choice at the ballot box. The candidates you are allowed to choose from were selected by secret committees, beholden to special interests. American voters are only given the choice between two candidates, both of whom have been vetted by society's elites in advance, and so in a way your vote doesn't really matter. Whoever gets in power is generally going to do whatever the plutocracy wants, first and foremost, and then secondly, whatever the partisan institution wants. What voters want is a tertiary consideration at best. And it's within this context that both Democrats and Republicans have worked together to ensure that they're the only parties who will have a meaningful shot at achieving power in US elections.

Parliamentary systems and proportional systems, on the other hand, tend to be multi-party systems and are more politically moderate and reflective of the overall population's will, since they are more closely centered around consensus and compromise. The executive can also be subject to a no confidence vote in these systems, so they have to be more sensitive to what the people around them want. And the judicial branch in a parliamentary system is beholden to the elected government rather than its own partisan whims, irrespective of what the public wishes.

The Founders believed that any government where authority is not derived from the will of the majority is illegitimate. Our system at every level is designed to ensure that a few people get their way, while any deviation from the status quo line is suppressed before it even has a chance to be discussed. Food for thought about what it means to actually live in the ""Land of the Free.""",7,2024-12-11 17:30:43,2024-12-12 00:11:51,0.6

Intelligence agencies and the IAEA haven’t confirmed an active weapons program.

But what I don’t get is:  
Why would Iran enrich uranium to 60% purity, when nuclear power reactors only use 3–5% enriched uranium?  
That seems like a huge red flag — especially since going from 60% to weapons-grade (90%) is a much smaller step than going from 3%.

Iran claims the 60% enrichment is for medical isotope production, but from what I’ve read, medical applications (like producing technetium-99m) only require around 20% enrichment at most. So that explanation doesn’t seem to hold up. Why would they go three times higher than necessary if the goal was medical?

If they’re not building a bomb, then what are they doing it for?

For example, if the question is ""Why did X happen?"" then the only acceptable answers are ""Because of Y and here are sources for Y""?

Ask_Politics,top,Once more with feeling: Upcoming Rule Updates and Enforcement,"Now that the election is over and the immediate fallout has more or less settled, we wanted to inform you of some upcoming rule updates, how these are enforced, and how you can appeal.  The goal is to make answers better sourced and try to get higher quality sources as well.  We've still got a ways to go, but this should help.

The **first change** is to Rule 3 and top-level comments.  Before it was *heavily* suggested to include sources and **now it will become a requirement** and enforced by the automod.  In almost every case I can think of, you can find a source to backup your reply to the question, whether its Wikipedia, a news article or even a link to primary source such as a video or transcript.  If for some reason we find an edge case where there is no ability to provide a source, it can be appealed (detailed below)

The **second change** is not so much a specific rule but how we will view sources and that we will encourage *primary* sources to be used to reinforce *secondary* sources.  As a reminder, primary sources are the raw event generally recorded around the same time it was said, written, or done - a video of a politician's speech, a court opinion and so on.  A secondary source is one who takes that primary source and generally analyzes it or summarizes it for easier consumption - in this case, an opinion article about that court ruling or a YouTuber digesting what a proposed new law would mean.  The goal of this change is to try to get as close to the primary source, the raw information, as possible and then use the secondary sources to reinforce your post.  

For example, let's say Ronald McDonald said he'd provide free kids meals to fight childhood hunger, you'd link to the clown actually saying it on video or the release from the Office of Ronald McDonald.  But then, seeing as this might have impacts down the road, you might link to Burger King News calling the new plan a threat  (""flame-grilled is better"") and their opinion that this will lead to further childhood obesity.

The ultimate goal of this rule is to help establish the facts surrounding the question so our time here isn't spent arguing over that (the raw data is there for anyone to see) but rather trying to explain what it means or how it works.  This will also help with baseless claims or bad takes since they'll be forced to address the ultimate source rather than sticking to talking points - which will help keeping things from breaking Rule 4.

Finally, the **last change** will generally just be better rule enforcement.  Given the period, we let posts through that were not formatted as a question, some bad punctuation and grammar, as well as some ""short"" questions that didn't quite demonstrate that the poster had tried to do some research themselves.  We will begin starting to enforce this more rigorously going forward.

(Resubmitted, **again** to see if the new, **new** rules work...)",5,3,2,">Some new policies, like the Republicans not caring much about opposing gay marriage anymore, don't really have a policy-based reason. Its just because its not a popular/winning message anymore.

So what I would do in this example would be to do a google search for something like ""conservative opinion on gay marriage polling over time"", open a handful of replies in new tabs, and pick one or more sources which contain recent and relevant data and links to primary sources (or at least say exactly where the data came from) if it isn't a primary source itself.  Heck, you should do this before you start writing, so you don't find yourself wasting time.

[This was one of the top results I got](https://news.gallup.com/poll/646202/sex-relations-marriage-supported.aspx), which includes polling data from 1996 to 2024 showing that support for gay marriage among republicans increased from 16% in '96 to 46% in 2024, with a peak of 55% in '21-'22.

As for the *whys* that would be more speculative, I agree, but it's good to start with a framework that supports the premise.  But even still, the ""Bottom Line"" touches on it to an extent:

>As the percentage of Americans who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or something other than heterosexual continues to rise in the U.S., public support for same-sex marriage and views of the morality of same-sex relations remain high

...

>With younger Americans consistently more likely than older Americans to favor legal same-sex marriage and to view same-sex relations as morally acceptable, public support should resume its growth at some point in the coming decades, should younger adults and new generations entering adulthood maintain higher levels of support.

Circumstantial evidence is leagues better than no evidence, you just have to work a bit harder to make your case than if you had a smoking gun.  And if nothing else, it can be helpful to be clear which parts of an argument are backed by hard data, which are supported by circumstantial evidence, and which is speculation grounded more in lived experience and anecdotes.

If you wanted to argue that greater representation in media is a factor, you could include a quote [like this](https://student.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/2022/02/17/lgbt-history-month-a-history-of-lgbt-representation-in-tv-film/comment-page-1/) (from a quick google for ""gay representation in media over time""):

>Since 2005, GLAAD has published an annual report to show how representation is changing in TV. In the 2005-2006 season, 1.4% of regular characters on broadcast primetime shows were LGBTQ+, whilst in 2020-2021, the figure was up to 9.1% – and over half of these characters were people of colour. It is important to remember though that more can be done – the most recent study found that 20% of these LGBTQ+ characters appeared in a series created by just 1 of 4 TV producers.

And while we've all heard that correlation does not necessarily imply causation, it's not like the correlation proves the opposite either.  Not a smoking gun, but a plausible basis for further argumentation.",2,2024-11-13 18:32:29,2024-11-13 20:32:45,0.3

Well....

In 2011, the Vermont legislature passed Act 48, allowing Vermont to replace its current fragmented system--which is driving unsustainable health care
costs-- with Green Mountain Care, the nation’s first universal, publicly financed health care system

Vermont's single payer system would have to be financially supported through a payroll tax.

*  12.5 percent in 2015 and 11.6 percent in 2019, including a 3 percent contribution from employees.

--------
In 2014, Vermont's legislator changed the plan and decided that raising state income taxes up to 9.5 percent and placing an 11.5 percent Corp Tax Rate on Business was the only way to fund the expenses.

Calling it the biggest disappointment of his career, Gov. Peter Shumlin says he is abandoning plans to make Vermont the first state in the country with a universal, publicly funded health care system.

> * I have supported a universal, publicly financed health care system my entire public life, and
believe that all Vermonters deserve health care as a right, regardless of employment or income.
Our current way of paying for health care is inequitable. I wanted to fix this at the state level, and
I thought we could. I have learned that the limitations of state-based financing – limitations of
federal law, limitations of our tax capacity, and sensitivity of our economy – make that unwise
and untenable at this time.

* Today we are releasing the [Green Mountain Care financing report](https://hcr.vermont.gov/sites/hcr/files/pdfs/GMC%20FINAL%20REPORT%20123014.pdf) we developed that led me to
the difficult conclusion that now is not the time to move forward with a publicly-financed health
care system in Vermont. In the coming weeks we will be publishing additional materials from
our research on the website http://hcr.vermont.gov/library. Vermonters will have access to all of
the analysis that we used to come to the difficult decision we made.
I hope this report gives us a common understanding of the detailed assumptions and facts needed
for the work we must do over the coming legislative session to continue long-lasting, meaningful
health care reform in Vermont.

>“These are simply not tax rates that I can responsibly support or urge the Legislature to pass,” the Governor said. “In my judgment, the potential economic disruption and risks would be too great to small businesses, working families and the state’s economy.”",5,2024-11-12 20:17:58,2024-11-13 02:41:52,0.5

In October, [a plurality of polled voters (42%)](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25252151/cnn-poll-on-2024-presidential-race.pdf) stated they had no strong opinions one way or the other on trans issues. That was after the Republican campaign placed about $100 million dollars down on vehemently anti-trans ads.

In November - after the election - voter attitudes switched to [a plurality (43%)](https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2024/11/21/dddbb/3), but only when the answer mentioned ""upholding traditional definitions of gender."" The particular problem there is I don't really like how that answer is worded - transgender people are not some kind of special third gender. They just identify as male or female. Nonetheless I think most people who answer 'yes' to that would be nominally anti-trans in some way.

Pretty much all the polling illustrating anti-trans attitudes among Independent voters comes after the election already occurred - so a early-to-late November timeframe. Prior to that, support splits relatively neatly along party lines. 

I think what people are struggling with here is *ex post facto justification* for voting for Trump. A lot of Independents were clearly intending to vote for Trump the entire time, but need to vocalize some kind of justification that makes them come off as more persuadable than they actually are. I've witnessed this in-person quite a lot since the campaign kicked off - many people wanted Trump for a variety of reasons, but don't want to articulate exactly why that is, so they make up a plausible reason that they suddenly 'switched.' The reality is that research shows time and time again - American voters are not persuaded by ads. They don't watch them and don't make up their minds based on single ads. [It entirely depends on the frequency of their exposure to many, many ads, and their larger information system.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01487-4) More so than that one ad, the anti-trans *campaign* run by the Republican party and their enthusiastic backers running important digital platforms such as Elon Musk affected voters over time and boosted turnout enough to get the barest points necessary for a win. 

I'll say I've never actually met someone that solely voted for something based on anti-trans rights. They're almost always hiding other beliefs that they just aren't comfortable vocalizing to someone they don't think will reciprocate.

Hope that provides some clarity. Can't answer on how other ads compare; would say in 2016 we saw a very similar information environment in regard to Trump voters and digital advertising.",1,2024-11-27 09:08:08,2024-11-28 15:23:40,0.6

Most who might care about the T issue were likely decided voters.

However, if the ad was effective , It was effective because it highlighted and reminded people that in first few years of their reign, the Biden Harris team steam rolled ahead on matters/ topics that most citizens don’t understand ( TQIAplus, DEI) in law and policies and has in fact made their lives more difficult while also prioritizing non-US Americans and other identity politics issues over issues and real world struggles (like the economy, safety, free speech) that many were concerned with. The Dems also say they did great with economy. Well, Then they did a horrible job communicating that which is another thing the ad did well. 

Dems being horrible at communicating their priorities and successes is also what the ad did well. It highlighted Harris’ crap communication in interviews and town halls. Is trans surgeries for felons a priority to the Dems? If not then why is this one of clearest stance quotes gotten from Harris during the whole campaign (that interview itself was not during the campaign but that is also part of the point) while Harris was too vague on solid action and policies and in all her interview history? 

And a although, Dem voters, Dem supporters, TQI plus activists will swear up and down all day long That trans is not an issue anyone cares about, the number one thing every day people noticed and heard from others behind close doors, in anonymous spaces, was  the fear of reprisal;  therefore silence,  around any concern or topic of TQI Plus and even other social justice issues like Israel Palestine. The fear of reprisal or ostracization,  therefore silence around this issue equals self -censorship (because of fear) and citizens taking a closer look at the encroachment on foundational us US American freedoms and closer at this issue no one can talk about freely (especially if they have a dissenting opinion).",1,2024-11-27 09:08:08,2024-12-07 17:00:33,-0.8

Because of that, it's hard to answer your question comprehensively - the Trump Administration's actions will be constitutional or unconstitutional largely based on the context in which they occur.

SCOTUS has heard two main cases regarding Queer rights: \[*Obergefell v. Hodges*\](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2014/14-556) and \[*Bostock v. Clayton County*\](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2019/17-1618)*. Obergefell* held that a state statute barring gay marriage was unconstitutional both under the right-to-privacy line of cases (*Griswold, Roe, Casey*), and under the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause. *Bostock* held that Title VII, which prohibits sex discrimination in employment matters and arose from the Civil Rights Acts, does apply to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.

So, what does this mean? Queer rights to marry are likely protected generally under the 14th Amendment. Queer rights against discrimination in the workplace are much more constrained, because the reasoning of *Bostock* relied on the definition of ""sex"" when evaluating sexual orientation. Queer rights outside of the employment or marriage context are entirely subject to review, and Federal policies regarding grants, educational material, contracting, etc. can likely be changed without violating pre-existing law. Whether those changes survive a constitutional challenge is up in the air, but I wouldn't hold your breath on *Bostock* being expanded beyond Title VII.

Last thing, and it's quite important, the Trump Campaign was incredibly aggressive towards specifically Trans rights, not Queer rights generally. (You can quibble as to whether they will care about the difference now that they are in power). And Trans rights have *never* been evaluated by the Supreme Court. No constitutional case has posed that particular question, and there are relevant differences between being gay/bi/etc. and being Trans. The fact that Trans issues do include healthcare issues - which is somewhere the government has been shown to have constitutionally more power than issues of privacy - means that a policy banning healthcare for Trans kids/adults might survive constitutional scrutiny under this SCOTUS.

Happy to discuss further, but there are many more far more qualified individuals than I to ask on this. One such person is my friend u/oleanderclaire.

I'd quibble with that. Bostock v Clayton County was a consolidated case that addressed both. Gerald Lynn Bostock is gay and so is Donald Zarda. Aimee Stephens is trans. Justice Gorsuch opens powerfully:

""The statute’s message for our cases is equally simple and momentous: An individual’s homosexuality or transgender status is not relevant to employment decisions. That’s because it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex. Consider, for example, an employer with two employees, both of whom are attracted to men. The two individuals are, to the employer’s mind, materially identical in all respects, except that one is a man and the other a woman. If the employer fires the male employee for no reason other than the fact he is attracted to men, the employer discriminates against him for traits or actions it tolerates in his female colleague. Put differently, the employer intentionally singles out an employee to fire based in part on the employee’s sex, and the affected employee’s sex is a but-for cause of his discharge. Or take an employer who fires a transgender person who was identified as a male at birth but who now identifies as a female. If the employer retains an otherwise identical employee who was identified as female at birth, the employer intentionally penalizes a person identified as male at birth for traits or actions that it tolerates in an employee identified as female at birth. Again, the individual employee’s sex plays an unmistakable and impermissible role in the discharge decision.

That distinguishes these cases from countless others where Title VII has nothing to say. Take an employer who fires a female employee for tardiness or incompetence or simply supporting the wrong sports team. Assuming the employer would not have tolerated the same trait in a man, Title VII stands silent. But unlike any of these other traits or actions, homosexuality and transgender status are inextricably bound up with sex. Not because homosexuality or transgender status are related to sex in some vague sense or because discrimination on these bases has some disparate impact on one sex or another, but because to discriminate on these grounds requires an employer to intentionally treat individual employees differently because of their sex.

If you don't have an ID, you wouldn't be able to register to vote. In most precincts, you still need an ID to vote. In every precinct, you need to be registered.

There is a thing called a 'provisional ballot', which is where a lot of misinformation and confusion originates. This is a ballot for if there is some disagreement about your registration status (say you registered but for some reason you aren't on their list, or you're voting in the wrong precinct due to an address change or something). Anyone can fill out a provisional ballot. However, provisional ballots will only be counted if they are fully vetted: there is a high threshold of certainty that needs to be met to validate the authenticity and legality of said ballot before it gets counted.

",0,0,0,"On top of other answers already posited, the reason it doesn't get fixed is because it's a political football. 

The obvious solution would be to issue every citizen a voter ID, but in order to make this fair it has to be issued to everyone for free. As a country it was long ago decided that any fee required to allow you to vote was illegal\*, as this was a tool used to disenfranchise poor(mostly formerly enslaved) people. A voter ID is a popular idea, but it runs into  opposition for a few reasons:

1. There are, contrary to popular belief, no federal elections in the US for ordinary people. Elections are all held by individual states. When it comes to voting for president, it's just an election to tell your state representatives how to cast ballots in the federal election they participate in.  
  
2. States generally create ballots exclusively by address. What I mean by this is, your voting is done by where you live. If you move to a new address in the same state, and you don't change your address on your voter registration, you won't be allowed to vote at your new home.\*\* There's a patchwork of laws on how to address this, including for people who are currently living outside the country and military.

3. And most importantly not having a simple solution (eg, issue everyone ballots for all races their eligible to vote in(eg, statewide races) leaves a problem you can continually point to. There's more political benefit to NOT letting people vote if you hold positions that would not survive a popular vote in a fair election. 

\*That said, there are still ways to make poll taxes exist-for example, the restoration of voting rights in place like Florida for former felons requires paying a fine. It's legally dubious, but hasn't got enough support to challenge it.

\*\*Most states offer some degree of provisional ballots, with varying levels of acceptance criteria. Some never get counted unless it's a close race, or some other circumstance exists,  some allow votes to be tallied separately for local vs statewide elections. There's really no uniformity to voting in the US.",2,2024-10-30 06:04:51,2024-10-30 17:22:29,0.5

Any possible reasons?",7,4,3,"The devil is often in the details but the long and short of it is the DNC and RNC have colluded to make sure that the electoral system favors a[ two party duopoly.](https://secondratedemocracy.com/the-two-party-duopoly/)

Since they're in charge of the campaign laws, they place all sorts of formal and informal constraints around individuals and groups in terms of the entry requirements to even get put on a ballot.

But also, on another level, they create a situation where voters and political candidates alike are in a bit of a [prisoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma). Things like [first past the post voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting), gerrymandering, voter obstruction laws, the [electoral college](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College), and institutional inertia favor an ""all or nothing"" partisan power structure.

As a voter, the only way you can ensure you get what you want is if you either vote all Democrat or all Republican, depending on your political leanings. And this is deliberate. This dynamic is by design and it ensures the two party duopoly remains intact.

Even the three branch structure of government itself favours the partisan duopoly. The way the US government is structured, POTUS is always the head of their partisan organization, in addition to being the head of state, the head of cabinet agencies, the head of foreign policy, and the head of the armed forces. That's a lot of incumbent authority to place in the hands of one of only two parties every election cycle. Also, any party with a simple majority in Congress wields incredible power over the minority party, since they can simply gridlock any proposed legislation at a procedural and committee level before it even reaches the assembly for consideration.

Even the judicial branch contributes to this, somewhat. Because SCOTUS is not beholden to the other two branches after a Justice is confirmed at the Senate level, anytime a party manages to stuff it with ideologically right or left justices, the court will be a partisan force in favour of one particular ideology or another potentially for decades, even if the popular will has shifted substantially.

Parties also make sure that people within their own ranks can't reasonably deviate from the party line, which further supresses diversity of choice at the ballot box. The candidates you are allowed to choose from were selected by secret committees, beholden to special interests. American voters are only given the choice between two candidates, both of whom have been vetted by society's elites in advance, and so in a way your vote doesn't really matter. Whoever gets in power is generally going to do whatever the plutocracy wants, first and foremost, and then secondly, whatever the partisan institution wants. What voters want is a tertiary consideration at best. And it's within this context that both Democrats and Republicans have worked together to ensure that they're the only parties who will have a meaningful shot at achieving power in US elections.

Parliamentary systems and proportional systems, on the other hand, tend to be multi-party systems and are more politically moderate and reflective of the overall population's will, since they are more closely centered around consensus and compromise. The executive can also be subject to a no confidence vote in these systems, so they have to be more sensitive to what the people around them want. And the judicial branch in a parliamentary system is beholden to the elected government rather than its own partisan whims, irrespective of what the public wishes.

The Founders believed that any government where authority is not derived from the will of the majority is illegitimate. Our system at every level is designed to ensure that a few people get their way, while any deviation from the status quo line is suppressed before it even has a chance to be discussed. Food for thought about what it means to actually live in the ""Land of the Free.""",6,2024-12-11 17:30:43,2024-12-12 00:11:51,0.5

Ask_Politics,controversial,"As a foreigner, I am curious about why does the Democratic Party object to Voter Identification with a Photo ID?",A photo ID requirement is almost universal in the rest World. Why is this a big deal in the US?,89,67,22,"The LWV gives a good example here:  
[https://www.lwv.org/blog/whats-so-bad-about-voter-id-laws](https://www.lwv.org/blog/whats-so-bad-about-voter-id-laws)  
  
There's a few issues:  
1. Government issued photo IDs are not given out freely. Young voters who live in cities or on school campuses often don't have need to get a photo ID, so there's no point in applying for one. If you don't need to drive anywhere, you don't need to get a license. And if you're not planning to leave the country, you don't need a passport. 

Similarly, these forms of ID are not automatically updated with your address when you move. In the US, elections are conducted explicitly based on where you live, with districts cutting between neighborhoods. (There are no ""presidential elections"", just deciding how your state should vote.) So, if the ID you got when you were 18 says you live in Dallas, but you're trying to vote a year later after you moved to San Antonio, you're not going to be allowed to vote with a strong voter ID law-or at best, you'll get a provisional ballot which likely won't be counted anyway.

Changing these IDs is not an unbearable burden, but it's also not trivial. There's a fee associated and you have to spend hours at the DMV(letters vary by state, but it's essentially the place that handles photo IDs for driver's licenses), which are notoriously slow and culturally understood to be the height of bureaucratic slowness. Since most people don't get paid for taking time off and it occurs during a workday, AND most people under the age of 30 move more frequently, it's a process that not only costs the fees, but the time spent AND the time not earning wages.

2. Voter ID is pitched to solve the problem of a very specific type of fraud-that of someone claiming to be someone they're not at the poll. Impersonation voter fraud is not at all a problem in any real sense. Like, it literally happens less than once out of every million ballots cast. And every election board in the country has provisional ballots to ensure that someone's vote is not counted twice or stolen.   
  
3. Having a government issued photo ID as the requirement pulls in the opposite direction of vote by mail and in so doing, creates a structure that suppresses voter turnout. Voting in the US is conducted on one day that is not treated as a holiday (although more states have been doing imperfect early voting). A law making it mandated to vote in person, with your ID has all of the problems of the first point above and actively reduces votes for people who 1) are out of the country, 2) working/doing childcare during the week 3) have mobility issues or illness on the voting day(s). 

In sum, at it's best, good faith interpretation mandatory voter ID is a solution to a problem that doesn't actually exist and in actual practice it's designed to suppress votes.",23,2024-11-24 14:11:13,2024-11-24 17:17:03,0.9

To get the initial voter approved copy here are the required documents that have to be brought to the government office in person: https://www.flhsmv.gov/driver-licenses-id-cards/what-to-bring/u-s-citizen/

 Every time you change your name (marriage/divorce), you have to bring those documents in person. 

The offices in less affluent areas are packed, sometimes inconveniently located, only open during conventional working hours, and with an appointment can still take over an hour.

They expire every 10 years, though replacement copies can be ordered online if you have a credit/debit card. 

 To the average person that sounds simple enough, but to the poor who are more likely to have less stable housing & financial situations? The elderly who no longer need to drive? Anyone who lives in a remote location and/or is barely scraping by? Those required documents are also not cheap or easy to replace if lost and mostly unnecessary otherwise, so many just go without.

The mainstream media was absolutely shocked, which is insane, given that overturning Roe v Wade had been the cornerstone of the conservative legal movement for 40+ years.

What I'm getting at is that, when Trump says he's concerned about illegal immigrants and is going to deport them, I think it's very naive to ignore the fact that [anti-immigration, white supremacists Stephen Miller] (https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/stephen-miller) is going to be his deputy chief of staff. It's naive to ignore the fact the past and future head of ICE, [Tom Homan, has stated the family separation won't be a problem, because he's fine deporting entire families, including American citizens] (https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/10/tom-homan-ice-mass-deportation-family-separation-60-minutes/). Hell, Trump himself has promised to deport 15M people. There are only an estimated 11M illegal immigrants in the US.

I'm not constructing an ideological straw-man. I've looked at the political landscape recognized that I'm being lied to. When they claim to be talking about illegal immigrants, they're not just talking about illegal immigrants. 

So, sure, are there people who are fine with immigrants, as long as they go through legal channels? Sure. But I'm not interested in an abstract discussion divorced from reality. I'm interested how the people in power will wield that power.",11,2024-11-18 16:44:13,2024-11-19 01:29:17,0.9
Ask_Politics,controversial,Do people see through ideological strawman fallacies?,"Independent here. 

I'm curious if people see through ideological strawman fallacies.

For example:

From the right: When someone states climate changes, there has always been climate change. Where, in fact, it's about human-caused climate change and better environmental practices. 

From the left: When someone states that there is an anti-immigrant sentiment. Where, in fact, it's about   undocumented (illegal) immigration and welcoming legally entered immigrants. 

I'm curious if people observe this happening or if my understanding of logical fallacies is faulty. 

",0,0,0,The Roe point is absolutely true.

Thanks in advance.",52,39,13,"From a logistical standpoint, there are a couple things that stick out.

The biggest for me is that by winning this time, Trump will be able to replace several Supreme Court justices--Alito, Thomas, and possibly Roberts. He will likely replace them with very young people, which ensure that the Court would remain conservative-leaning for many decades to come. The first time Trump was elected, the implications for the Court were bad, but they were fixable within the next decade or so. At this point, Trump's election basically ensures that liberal legislation will be struck down by the courts for the rest of my life. Even if the Democrats find a way to win back Congress and pass legislation, the Supreme Court won't uphold most of it.

Second, there's a lot less Republican resistance to Trump this time around. Last time, Paul Ryan controlled the House, and the Senate Republican coalition was very anti-Trump. This ensured that they wouldn't even bring up a lot of the stuff that Trump wanted to do for a vote in the House or Senate. This time, the coalitions are a lot friendlier to his priorities, and he has more control over them. He also appointed a *lot* of judges to the lower-level courts during his first presidency, which means a lot less friction for his legislative goals in general.

Third, in 2016 a lot of people convinced themselves that Trump's presidency was a fluke. We didn't know what his presidency looked like, and he didn't win the popular vote, so it was easy for people to believe that this wasn't the will of the voters. This time it clearly is, even though they know exactly what a Trump presidency will look like. That's hard for a lot of people to accept.

However ... I guess I don't really agree with the premise that people are going more bananas over this election than 2016. At least among people I know, they were *much* more shocked and upset in 2016. The reaction this year is pretty muted compared to how bad it was then.",149,2024-11-12 18:50:16,2024-11-12 19:32:58,0.65

The President has a lot of power in the US and party loyalties are very strong right now. In 2016, Trump campaigned as a demogogue, but people didn't really know how he would govern. He didn't know either, which is why he staffed his administration with a lot of experienced, mainstream Republicans.

Since then, the party has been purged of almost all its traditionalists. They've all been driven out, either reputationally or electorally. The biggest symbol of this shift is the change from Mike Pence to JD Vance as the Vice President, but there are many others as well. Trump's daughter in-law is co-chair of the party now. Anyone who might serve as a check on his authoritarian instincts is gone and won't be coming back.

Simultaneously, Trump knows how to work the levers of power much better now. In 2016, he had never even held elected office. Now, he's been President for four years and has been shoring up his political support since then. He'll be much more capable of enacting his agenda.

And for the opposition, his agenda is scary. In his first term, he appointed Supreme Court justices (they serve for life) who not only overturned rights people feel are fundamental, but also ruled that the President has much broader immunity than most people previously thought he had, giving Trump carte blanche to push the boundaries of what we traditionally found acceptable. His loyalty-tested majorities in both houses of Congress won't stop him.

He has also promised to take significantly more severe actions this time around. He's repeatedly made physical threats against his political opponents, which he didn't do in 2016. And when he was running then, he talked about securing the border and deporting undocumented immigrants who had committed crimes, but this time, he's talking about deporting *all* of them in massive waves that could be very disruptive. His proposed tariff regime is also much more broad than anything he proposed in his first administration.

These are just a few things that make this time potentially different, but in truth, we don't quite know how he's going to govern, because he has a history of saying he's going to do stuff that he never does.",10,2024-11-12 18:50:16,2024-11-13 00:08:29,0.7

Thanks in advance.",52,39,13,"A lot of it has to do with the margins. In 2016, yes the Dems lost, but they lost in a rather fluky way. Trump got JUST enough votes to swing key states by the slimmest of margins, and even that only happened because of Comey's fluky investigation into Clinton a week before the election. But this election, Harris lost by a rather convincing margin in literally every swing state. This wasn't a close race that was narrowly lost with an unclear public mandate. This was a direct and clear and notable rejection of the incumbents.

Also, it should be noted that Biden had an objectively VERY good presidency. He accomplished more meaningful legislation than anyone since...LBJ? That's huge. Yes, inflation sucked, but that was also a global phenomenon that swept across every major political system and the US handled that MUCH better than anyone else, plus a lot of that had to directly with actions taken by the administration. Biden will be a president who gets much love from the history books, and so for a lot of Dems they're caught in the despair of ""if we couldn't win with THAT kind of track record, then what even is the point of anything at all?""

Finally, there's a perception that Trump should be a much weaker candidate now than in 2016. In 2016 he was at least somewhat of an unknown quantity and hadn't really governed poorly yet. In 2024, Trump is a convicted felon, a traitor who sold state secrets, someone who incited an insurrection, mishandled the pandemic, had very few if any policy victories, etc. That Trump was so bad and Biden was so good is just adding to the Dem despair right now.

One last note is that I do think there's a bit of overreaction and recency bias going on. There were MANY folks in 2016 who thought this was the end of US democracy and that Trump getting elected was one of the worst things to ever happen to this country. We had a tremendous amount of ""not my president"" and a lot less resignation than we're seeing this time around. (Just to be clear, resignation is not a bad thing--Dems should be still committed to election results even if they are atrocious.) Also, as you pointed out, despite Harris's very poor performance, the Congressional races were much better and Trump will likely have a hard time implementing the more incendiary parts of his agenda without sweeping coattails.",12,2024-11-12 18:50:16,2024-11-12 21:22:58,0.8
